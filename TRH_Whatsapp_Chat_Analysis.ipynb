They added only 1500/- to my old salary\" Because of her meager salary, I’ve taken up so many responsibilities in the house without complaint. I pay for utilities and pay for food. I pay the fees of our two kids, clothe them, and take care of their medical bills. When my wife sends me a grocery list, she adds sanitary pads. She buys dresses and clothes, comes to show them to me, and asks me to pay for them. She started talking about a car when our second child came in. Things weren’t good on my side so I asked her to give me some time. She said, “I’ve saved something. I can add it to what you have so you pay me when your money comes.”\\n', '.\\n', 'I agreed and took that money from her, topped it up to get her a car. For three months my ears never had rest.

Please log out for me.” \\n', 'I was about to log out when something caught my attention. I saw a mail with the subject, “January Payslip.” I opened and started going through.

I felt cheated. I felt played. We’ve been married for six good years and my wife earned that much without my knowledge? How much she earned didn’t bother me a lot than what she was using that money for. I decided not to talk immediately but rather do a little bit of investigation.\\n', '.\\n', 'All my life I’ve held the view that it wasn’t right for anyone to go through their partner’s phone.

He had sent photos of the various stages of the building. At some point, her father said, “Thank you for helping out your brother. He would have been home had it not been you.”\\n', '.\\n', 'She has only one brother, her senior brother. I went to look for the chat between them. Her senior brother lost his job and was home doing nothing so my wife bought him a car to use for Uber. Every week, her brother rendered an account and they split the money. From all indications, my wife was doing well for herself while she plays poor so she could rely on my salary. Why would she do that? I thought I was being a supportive husband so my wife could be proud of the man she married. When we bought land, it was her name and my name that appeared on the land title. That car I bought for her with a loan from her bears her name. I didn’t mind. I believed what’s hers was also mine.\\n', '.\\n', 'The next morning she realized I wasn’t looking well. I was boiling on the inside but looking for a good opportunity to start the conversation. When I calmed down a little, I asked her, “So why would you do that to me?” \\n', 'She asked, “What have I done?” \\n', 'I answered, “You bought land, you never told me. You started building on it, you never told me. When are you going to tell me?” \\n', 'She was shocked. \\n', 'She asked, “Who told you all that?” \\n', 'I said, “Your father did.” She stood quiet for a while. \\n', 'She asked, “Why would my father tell you all that? What were you people talking about” \\n', 'I said, “I don’t know. You can ask him.”\\n', '.\\n', 'We left it there. Some minutes later she came to me with her phone: “My father wants to talk to you.” The phone was already on a loudspeaker. His father was clearly angry. \\n', 'He asked, almost shouting, “You said I told you my daughter has a building, Where did I say that and when?” \\n', 'I  asked, “Is it not true that my wife has a building project going on that you’re supervising?” \\n', 'He asked me, “I told you that?” \\n', 'I asked, “Is it true or not?” After the back and forth I told them, “I read your messages last night. I saw the pictures. I read the various budget you had sent to my wife. I read the confirmation of the money receipts that you sent her. You’re a man. Would you be happy if your wife does this to you?” \\n', 'He started fumbling. He started apologizing saying he thought I was aware....\\n', '.\\n', 'My wife stood there motionless, didn’t know what to say. When her father hung up, I told her everything I knew, from her salary to the car she bought for her brother. I said, “Yet, even your sanitary pad, I buy them. You think I’m a fool? You’ll use your money to acquire your own properties and live on mine because you’re my wife? I hear. We’ll see.”\\n', '.\\n', 'Trust was lost. Love was broken. We had to find a new way of living our lives going forward. Her father called me every morning and evening apologizing for everything and sometimes taking up the blame so I didn’t have to blame his daughter. \\n', 'I told him, “The emotional state I’m in right now, it would be hard to think straight or think forgiveness. Just give me space.” \\n', 'Three days later, they were in our house. The father, the mother, and the senior brother. They came to apologize. \\n', '“Don’t let this break up the beautiful marriage you both have. If nothing at all, consider the kids and be lenient in your judgment.”\\n', '.\\n', 'I listened to them. My position was still the same. “I need time to clear my mind. Just leave me alone to think.” \\n', 'From last month to this moment that I’m writing this, my wife had changed totally. She doesn’t ask for money but the house is being run smoothly. She has started paying for things she never paid for but that doesn’t move me. She has taught me a very great lesson and I’m taking it seriously. That in everything, I have to look out for myself and my family first. \\n', 'Last she told me, “If you want us to change the names on those properties, we can do so.” \\n', 'Guess whose name is on the property…her father’s name.”\\n', '.\\n', 'I told her, “You don’t need to change anything. They are yours. You suffered for them so you can decide what you want to do with them.” \\n', 'The land I bought has our names. I’m selling it and take my money back. The car she’s driving has her name. I put a for-sale sticker on it some weeks ago. She agreed she’ll pay for the car. I’ve given her two months to pay up or I sell it and take my money. She’s getting the message and I’m glad. Each one for himself, God for us all. She keeps asking if I’m going to leave her. I keep telling her I won’t but if she wants a divorce, I will gladly give her. I’m not going to leave the marriage. I would give us some time to heal and see what may happen but when it comes to money, I’ve taken the lesson she taught me through her actions...\\n', '\\n', '#copied\\n', '[25/04/2024, 18:31:26] ~\\u202fYusuf Salisu Funtua: Will there be room for others to Join online?\\n', '\\u200e[25/04/2024, 19:27:57] Ibrahim Shafiu: Austin Kleon - Steal Like an Artist_ 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative-Workman Publishing Company (2012)(Z-Lib.io).pdf • \\u200e137 pages \\u200edocument omitted\\n', '[25/04/2024, 19:29:19] Malam Muhammad Uncle: Thank you Sir\\n', '[25/04/2024, 19:35:55] Ibrahim Shafiu: You’re welcome Sir🙌\\n', '[25/04/2024, 19:37:59] Yusuf Hamisu: “Creativity means undetected plagiarism”\\n', '\\n', '-Austin Kleon\\n', '[25/04/2024, 19:38:50] Ibrahim Shafiu: Wow😂🙌\\n', '[25/04/2024, 19:41:02] Ibrahim Shafiu: \\u200eThis message was deleted.\\n', '[26/04/2024, 06:19:46] Aliyu Lumumba Jr Suleiman: *\"Most of us are not celebrating the coups in Africa, what we are celebrating is the fall of despotic rulers ruling on behalf of the imperialists.

It shocked me…\\n', '\\n', 'I hear so many young entrepreneurs talk about 51%, and I’m immediately reminded of that conversation.\\n', '\\n', 'Now you want me to assure you that you will not “lose control” and I won’t because it all depends on your management of the business.

Even though they have small stakes, their investors did not oust them because they needed them to run the company and continue to innovate it to super growth.

While some have argued against this characterization, in one of the chapters of my book, “Tell, Don’t Yell,” I maintain that their brains are still developing. In other words, they’re incomplete. \\n', '\\n', 'In doing that, I used stories and science to argue my point. Enjoy. \\n', '\\n', 'The following stories and explanations by scientists will show that teenagers or young adults may be telling the truth when they do something reckless and say “I don’t know why I did it.”\\n', '\\n', 'Analyze this:\\n', '\\n', 'Some girls in a girls-only boarding school were being punished by the school. Outraged, they decided to burn down the school, starting with the room in which they were observing the time out. \\n', '\\n', \"If they had succeeded, they wouldn't have been alive to enjoy that victory. Because the unintended consequence of the fire consuming them would have incinerated their objective and their souls. \\n\", '\\n', 'In another boarding school,  this time a boys-only school, the senior students requested that the school and their teachers should help them to pass the external examinations. By help, they meant the school should allow them to cheat. \\n', '\\n', 'This wasn\\'t uncommon. They knew that their friends in other schools were being “helped\" by their teachers. Indeed, it was common for schools to bribe the external invigilator to look away so that the teachers could dictate or write answers on the board for students. \\n', '\\n', \"But the position of their management was clear: we will give you all the assistance you need provided it's not during the examinations.  \\n\", '\\n', 'The students thought that the school was joking. How will you exempt yourself from what every school is doing? They ask. \\n', '\\n', 'But when the first exams came and they saw that the school frustrated all their cheating attempts, they were livid. \\n', '\\n', 'Here’s where it gets interesting. \\n', 'They had a meeting and resolved to collectively fail if the school should refuse to help them during the exams. \\n', '\\n', 'By this, they meant to ruin the reputation of the school. No school wants to fail WAEC, that’s why so many of them cheat. So this position was a not-so-subtle threat. \\n', '\\n', \"It escaped them that if they failed they would lose at least one year before going to the university. When this was pointed out to them, it didn’t appear to affect their position. Why? Because they didn’t get it. The science below will explain why such reality didn't register. \\n\", '\\n', 'When I was in secondary and my WAEC fee wasn’t paid on time, I got angry. I looked at my friends who had already paid and felt sad. \\n', 'So I resolved to never go to school again if my WAEC fee wasn’t paid on time. It didn’t occur to me that it would affect only my own future if I refused to go to school. Why? Because I didn’t get it. \\n', '\\n', 'Why was it that these teenagers couldn’t grasp the consequences of their thoughts and actions?\\n', '\\n', 'Here’s the science. But this is an oversimplification of the function of the brain to explain behaviour. Even the experts, readily concede this. \\n', '\\n', 'Robert Sapolsky, a neuroscientist, asked, “What’s the best way to think about the brain? It’s insanely complicated [where] everything connects to everything that there are a gazillion little sub-regions.  But in the middle of that complexity, there’s a sort of simplified way to think about the aspect of the brain function when it comes to behaviour.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'To explain the brain, therefore, Paul MacLeans (a big shot in the field) came up with this explanation that categorizes the brain into three layers. The first layer is the reptilian brain. This is the part of the brain that we’re born with. We have no control over it. And it controls our autonomic nervous system such as breathing, temperature change and digestion. All the regulatory stuff. Reptilian because it suggests that we have the same wiring as the lizards. \\n', '\\n', 'The second layer is the limbic system. A mammalian speciality. Lizards are not known to possess this. This system controls our emotions. It has to do with fear, anxiety, arousal and so forth. We’re generally born with this system too. For example, nobody teaches a baby how to get angry when it’s hungry. \\n', '\\n', 'Sitting on the limbic system is the topmost layer which is called the neocortex. This is the system that is responsible for decisions and weighing the consequences of those decisions. This part of the brain doesn’t get developed until in our mid-twenties. Why is this crucial? \\n', '\\n', 'In a paper, titled “Maturation of the adolescent brain“ by Mariam Arain and her colleagues, the authors wrote:\\n', '“The development and maturation of the prefrontal cortex occurs primarily during adolescence and is fully accomplished at the age of 25 years.”\\n', '\\n', 'But why is this relevant to our discussion?\\n', '“The development of the prefrontal cortex is,” the authors continued, \"very important for complex behavioural performance, as this region of the brain helps accomplish executive brain functions.”\\n', '\\n', \"What this means is that all the teenagers and young adults who are giving their parents and teachers problems are still under construction. They are all less than 25. In other words, they don't yet possess all the tools or faculties to handle the type of reasoning we require of them. \\n\", '\\n', 'Once we understand that teenagers and young adults are incomplete, then we begin to appreciate their situation and empathize with them. Indeed, we begin to even marvel at the fact that they can do some sophisticated thinking. \\n', '\\n', 'The foregoing explanation is in the light of Paul MacLeans the triune brain. I concede that the theory itself is somewhat controversial. \\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In his obituary, the New York Times wrote in 2007, “Dr Thomas R. Insel, a neuroscientist and director of the National Institute of Mental Health in Rockville, Md., said the theory was ‘outside the mainstream of scientific effort,’ but added that Dr MacLean’s research had opened the door for neuroscience to ‘ask big questions about consciousness and philosophy, instead of the more tractable questions about vision and movement.’”\\n', '\\n', \"Yet, many notable neuroscientists, including Robert Sapolsky(author of “Behave”) have adopted this interpretation. For this book, therefore, I've done the same. \\n\", '\\n', 'However, the most important message of this chapter is something about which almost everyone is united: the neocortex gets fully developed in the mid-twenties.

Hon Abdulmalik Sarkin Daji, with the support of the Governor, the traditional institution and Muslim scholars, is sponsoring the wedding and businesses of 100 orphans. \\n', '\\n', 'But out of nowhere, we read, “Uju Kennedy-Ohanenye, minister of women affairs, has petitioned the inspector-general of police (IGP) and sought a court injunction to halt the marriage of 100 girls in Niger state.” TheCable reported. \\n', '\\n', '“I want to let the honourable speaker of the house in Niger state know that this is totally unacceptable by Federal Minister Of Women Affairs and by the government,” Kennedy-Ohanenye said.\\n', '\\n', 'The Muslim scholars in the North and Niger State in particular see the minister as an interloper and deem her comments as insults to both the northern tradition and the religion of Islam. \\n', '\\n', 'The Council of Imams in Niger State issued a one-week ultimatum to retract her comments. Dr Umar Farouk, the secretary of the Niger State Imam Forum, delivered the warning during a press briefing in Minna, the state capital. He stated that the Minister had overstepped her authority and that the Forum would not tolerate her remarks, which they believed could incite a crisis both in the state and nationwide.\\n', '\\n', \"The Speaker, himself a barrister, said: “I am highly disappointed in the minister for women's affairs and it is unfortunate that she allowed herself and her office to be misled by social media reports without finding out from me the true situation on the ground concerning this marriage.\\n\", '\\n', '\"This is politics taken too far by the minister. She should be properly educated on the culture and tradition of the north that girls of marriageable age are not allowed to roam the streets.”\\n', '\\n', 'Now Barrister Abdulmalik is refusing to participate in the wedding without withdrawing the financial support. \\n', '“If the parents wish to go ahead with the marriage of their daughters, so be it but I have removed my hands,” he said. \\n', '\\n', 'As for me, I think the minister made some dangerous assumptions in a bid to earn a name for herself. \\n', '\\n', 'First of all, she referenced the Child Rights Act and said that every child is a ward of the state. \\n', '\\n', '“Because there is something called the Child Rights Act and I said it from the onset, that it is no more business as usual. These children must be considered, their future must be considered, the future of the children to come out of their marriage must be considered,” she said. \\n', '\\n', 'Here, she assumed that the 100 orphans to be married were children. The more dangerous assumption is that any marriage in the North is done between men and girls. Because logically, if she jumps to the conclusion that these are girls, you must also admit the conclusion that she thinks only girls are married off in the north. She would be surprised that these are women in their late teens or early 20s. \\n', '\\n', 'The second assumption is that these “girls” have no education and have no skills. \\n', '\\n', \"The Minister said: “As the speaker did not think about empowering these women or sending them to school or giving them some kind of training support financially. The women's affairs have decided to take it up and we are going to educate the children.”\\n\", '\\n', 'We don’t know the level of their skill set, but the fact that northerners don’t want to send their children to school is stretched by some people to fit their theories. You would be surprised that these orphans have at least graduated from secondary school and have started a trade in which they only need money to scale. \\n', '\\n', 'I’ve sponsored some orphaned girls to school because they want to go to school. If the minister really wants to help, we have many girls who want to go to school but can’t afford it. I’ll personally help with the list. They’re in thousands. \\n', '\\n', 'So we’re lucky that the Minister is offering to sponsor our children. \\n', '\\n', 'The third assumption is that these orphans are being forced into marriage. It’s also the most irrational assumption. \\n', '\\n', \"The Speaker said: “She never bothered to get across to me to even find out the motive behind this Humanitarian gesture because I didn't force any girl into marriage, it was the parents of the girls that approached me and solicited for my support and I gladly accepted to assist them.”\\n\", '\\n', 'A committee screened those who applied for help and the list was reduced from 270 to 100 based on need. They applied! They sought help. And the help was specific: help us get married. What will the Speaker gain by forcing girls to marry other men?\\n', '\\n', 'If the minister did intend good, she could have cleared these assumptions by a simple request to the Speaker asking for the profiles of the ladies. The profiles don’t need to be detailed. Indeed, only three questions are enough: age or date of birth, level of education and employment status. Parental approval can also be added. \\n', '\\n', 'I’m sure the screening committee already has this information and could’ve emailed it to the Minister within minutes. Indeed, none of the “girls” is younger than 18, according to Dr Umar who has the list of all the ladies. \\n', '\\n', 'But in a bid to earn a name, she chose to pick a fight, a fight that she can’t win. More importantly, she’s causing needless problems for her principal among the people who still have doubts about the intentions of the presidency. \\n', '\\n', \"This woman has become the reactive minister. The first time I saw her was during the Lead British School bullying episode. Now, this. What’s she done that’s proactive? The Speaker said that she hasn't visited even one IDP camp in Niger State where these vulnerable women live. \\n\", '\\n', 'In sum, the speaker is a good guy who wants to help his people. I know because we’re neighbours. We just finished planting trees together. He sponsored the tree planting.  That’s the kind of guy he is.\\n', '[18/05/2024, 09:12:36] ~\\u202fyusufyusufgamji@gmail.com: Very apt!\\n', '[18/05/2024, 09:36:05] Engr.

You have to place \"TRUST\" on the Commercial Banks of Nigeria (including the Islamic Banks) on the fact that, they would be able to pay you back, anytime you want to withdraw your money and that these Commercial Banks would not go bankrupt!\\n', '\\n', \"Unfortunately, we have in the past witnessed in Nigeria, the runs on many Commercial Banks as well as financial panics, which proved the fact that, one cannot still be certain that his or her money are safe inside these Banks and notwithstanding the insurance of the deposits and heavy regulations of these Commercial Banks; are they, Sirs and Ma'ams?\\n\", '\\n', '*Fortunately, with Blockchain Technology, no any Commercial Banks are really needed (including the Islamic Banks) - you rather manage your Cryptocurrency yourself and if as a Cryptocurrency user, you strictly take right precautions on your Cryptocurrencies, you can be sure your Cryptocurrencies are right where you left them!*\\n', '\\n', '2. You have to equally \"TRUST\" the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will not create too much fiat  money, which can lead or result into inflation - CBN statutorily controls the issuance of currencies and coins in Nigeria, and as a legal tender and which are unfortunately not backed by any physical and valuable commodities (neither Silver nor Gold), but only the legal promise of the CBN to redeem them on demand and hence referred to as \"Fiat Money\"!\\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately, that currently in Nigeria we are experiencing running, if not galloping inflation, is an undisputed macroeconomic evidence to the macroeconomic fact that, CBN is printing too much money than our economy needs; furthermore, who remembers the Trillion Naira Ways and Means Advances (WMA) saga of the immediate past CBN Governor of Nigeria to the  immediate past political administration of Nigeria of former President Muhammad Buhari?\\n', '\\n', '*Fortunately, Cryptocurrency are neither created nor issued by any Central Bank or Central Authority anywhere in the world - they are rather created or mined by the networks of puzzle solvers, at a predictable and steady rate and hence the question of monetary inflation and or deflation does not even arise - this also means, the CBN like the Commercial Banks are also not needed in this our crypto era!*\\n', '\\n', '3. We have to equally \"TRUST\" the Payment Service Banks (PSBs) of Nigeria, such as Remita, PayPal, Visa, MasterCard etc would actually allow us to spend or accept money online, ensure there are no double spends and that they would not reverse our transactions and that they would equally allow us to spend our money as we like or wish!\\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately, that is not always the case; who remembers when the Wikileaks, that Political Advocacy Group in America, was soliciting for public donations, some Governments in conjunction with some PSBs such as PayPal and Visa refused to allow such public donations from their customers - a failure of trust!\\n', '\\n', '*Fortunately, Cryptocurrency using the Blockchain Technology is a peer to peer transactions, which means transactions occur directly from one user to another directly and with no middlemen, such as PSBs, Commercial Banks and even the almighty Central Banks!* \\n', '\\n', '4. We equally have to TRUST that, Governments of Nigeria cannot wake up one day to confiscate our money or restrict the type of things that we can buy with our money and for whatever political reasons!\\n', '\\n', \"Unfortunately, the events in Cyprus in 2013 show how dangerous Governments can be to our currency, where people's deposits were confiscated to pay for the country's debts!\\n\", '\\n', '*Fortunately, there is virtually nothing Governments can do to negatively impact on Cryptocurrency - they cannot confiscate any digital coins, like they cannot prevent users and owners of digital coins from spending their digital coins however they like, though Governments can target the Exchange Companies for such digital coins, such as Binance for example, albeit only at the point at which people buy or sell the digital coins for fiat currencies like Naira!*\\n', '\\n', '5. Finally, we have to TRUST that our identity would not be compromised by the financial institutions of Nigeria! \\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately, under the current monetary system, one must be compulsorily identified digitally to be able to use or transact business with any of the Nigerian financial institutions and hence the risks of such compromises are always there!\\n', '\\n', '*Fortunately, with Cryptocurrency, one can be and remained anonymous, even though all transactions are publicly viewable on the Blockchain - the sender and receiver of the digital coins are only known by a string of numbers and letters and as such, if one is careful, he or she can hardly be identified in the Blockchain!*\\n', '\\n', 'The above rationale behind the Blockchain Technology categorically shows that, the Shari\\'ah (Islamic Law) issues may not really be the employment and deployment of the technology per se, but simply on whether the development and employment of *\"Trustless System of Money\"* to conduct financial transactions, are actually in line with Maqasidul Shari\\'ah Al-Islamiyyah and hence halal or haram or not and to me, this is where an Islamic Legal Verdict (Fatwa) are urgently needed!\\n', '\\n', \"@ our Distinguished Islamic Scholars, in general and Shari'ah Scholars, in particular; over to you now, for such Islamic Legal Analysis and Islamic Legal Verdict (Fatwa) by extension!\\n\", '\\n', '*Jaumiraawo (Allah) woni andudo is a Fulani way of saying God knows best!*\\n', '\\n', 'References\\n', 'Elinda Lara (2013), Bitcoin For Beginners - the Complete Beginners Guide to Buying, Selling and Investing in Bitcoins!\\n', '\\n', '*This pieces was researched and compiled by Engr.

Nigerians are mostly on top of their classes abroad, and they compete favorably with other best students from all corners of the world who were taught with the so-called “up-to-date” curriculum. Some of us are living witnesses to this anomaly and the reason is simple! The Fundamental principles of Engineering Science such as gravity, thermodynamics, and fluid-mechanics in most curricula in the world are inherently similar. What is markedly different are not only the methods, areas, and propensities of cutting-edge applications, but the relative mastery, tools, delivery, understanding and environment of the instructor. The key concepts are meant for you to think. When these concepts are fully truly understood, one can solve any complex problem from his domain of expertise starting from first principle.\\n', '\\n', 'I have worked with the Mechanical Engineering curriculum of University College London (UCL), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and some modules in Cambridge University. These are the best universities in the world. I audited and developed curriculums in two MIT courses (2.005 Thermal Fluids Engineering and 2.60 Fundamentals of Advanced Energy Conversions), engaged 2nd and 3rd year UCL undergraduates in thermodynamic laboratories and developed engine laboratories similar to that of Cambridge.  My experience in all these is that because all the resources needed were readily available and the pedagogical learning outcomes were clear and students centered; these fundamental concepts were used to derive and solve unbelievably sophisticated equations whose physical meanings and applications were well intended. These are what I always call universal, natural, and settled concepts; but their usage and applications are dependent on the goal they are meant to achieve. Cambridge University has an integrated “Department” of Engineering NOT ‘Faculty” for a reason. Undergraduate Students are required to study general engineering in their 1st and 2nd year and then go ahead to specialize in their preferred engineering discipline in that 3rd year. The first two years are expected to groom students with most engineering science principles for interdisciplinary problem-solving capabilities. My MSc project supervisor (Emeritus Prof. Chris Lawn) in Queen Mary University of London was a Cambridge graduate. I marveled at how he developed from first principles, thermo-fluid equations representing instantaneous meso-scale combustion processes.\\n', '\\n', 'The fact that students from these global best institutions excel, and are industry ready, despite common key fundamental principles with the Nigerian curriculum is not a surprise. These institutions further advance fundamental concepts with contemporary grant-ready research, and they establish a vibrant ecosystem that fosters innovation and growth; hence easily attracting the best minds (students and staff) from all corners of the world. Meritocracy is their criteria for admission and employment of manpower. No wonder Boston Massachusetts, where MIT is situated; is an attractive center for start-ups and scale-ups Biotech companies. Nigerian universities can also translate these fundamental concepts to meaningful research and innovation, and for this to happen, the triple helix of Academia-Industry-Government should not continue to stand on only one-leg of the theoretical \"academia\" as the status-quo.\\n', '\\n', ' H A.

Simply put, managing our modern lifestyle is enriched by the memory of our pasts. \\n', '\\n', 'So, for the sake of my sanity, I choose to believe that this is what our elders in the red and green chambers were doing when they returned our national anthem. They looked to the past in order to restore the future of Nigeria. The problem is that when they went probing into the past, they opened a whole can of worms. I am talking about the whole damned tank with all the vile creatures creeping out and seeping into the future that none of us are prepared for.\\n', '\\n', 'These days when I see patients, whether in the clinic or elsewhere, a common presenting complaint is for me to change their medication to a cheaper alternative. They recognize that the medicines are working and sometimes mandatory especially with chronic diseases, however, they also need the doctor to realize that they cannot afford that particular brand. And so, you hear them asking: ‘Isn’t there another medicine that is cheaper or of lower quality?’  \\n', 'It is a very scary reality.\\n', '\\n', 'Ever since the discussion about the return of the old national anthem began, Nigeria began a sort of retrogressive decline. It is as if, with the return of the old anthem has brought back the hardship our forefathers faced in the fifties, sixties and seventies. You remember the stories we heard of only one household having a TV in the entire neighborhood, where everyone gathered to watch foreign movies? Well, now more and more homes are unable to afford a television. Or if they have one, they do not have electricity or cannot afford to power it (what with this Band XYZ nonsense). You remember the stories of how only few people could travel by Air because of how expensive it was? Well, at present international airlines are traveling out of Abuja with empty seats on board. You remember the stories of extreme poverty and starvation during the military rule when Nigerians had to beg for rations? Well, we are now back to the reality of begging for N35,000 palliative and minimum wage from the federal government.\\n', '\\n', 'That the economy has gone to the dogs is not news any longer. The day a man I know to be very wealthy by whatever yardstick or currency available asked me to change his medication from Exforge HCT (a Novartis brand for hypertension medication) to a cheaper brand is the day I realized the gravity of the situation. He told me quite frankly that he could not afford the N40,000 a month expense, in addition to his other bills. Patients that were previously able to afford dialysis are now dropping out like flies and dying silently. The matron of a labour room said to me that the staff can now sleep at night because very few people can afford the N35,000 delivery fee.\\n', '\\n', 'And yet, we sing.\\n', '\\n', 'We sing an outdated anthem about hailing our dear native land, Nigeria.

And we sing about handing the country’s flag to our children, without stain in a country free of oppression.\\n', '\\n', 'Exactly who are we fooling? \\n', '\\n', 'Between 2000 and 2014, Nigeria’s economy experienced broad-based and sustained growth of over 7% annually on average, benefitting from favourable global conditions, and macroeconomic and first-stage structural reforms. From 2015-2022, however, growth rates decreased and GDP per capita flattened, driven by monetary and exchange rate policy distortions, increasing fiscal deficits due to lower oil production and a costly fuel subsidy program, increased trade protectionism, and external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Weakened economic fundamentals led the country’s inflation to reach a 24-years high of 31.7% in February 2024, which, in combination with sluggish growth, has pushed millions of Nigerians into poverty.\\n', '\\n', 'Even though Nigeria has the biggest population and economy in Africa, most of its people have little possibilities. Young people roam the streets everyday carrying brown envelopes moving from office to office. More and more people are venturing into small scale businesses that provide very little profit.  Nigerians, with the 7th lowest human capital index in the world are predicted to be 36% less productive as workers in the future if they have complete access to healthcare and education. The 3.5 million Nigerians who enter the labour force each year are unable to find jobs, and many decide to leave their country in pursuit of better possibilities. It is an open secret that the rate of ‘Japa’ has skyrocketed in the last five years. Just last week a woman came to the clinic in search of a medical certificate of fitness because her ‘agent’ (and I use the term loosely) had secured a job for her in far-away Baghdad! All my efforts to dissuade her fell on deaf ears. \\n', '\\n', 'I stopped talking when she asked me what I could offer her instead. \\n', 'Sadly, the answer is nothing. I quickly shut my mouth and sent her on her way.\\n', '\\n', 'According to estimates, 87 million Nigerians live below the poverty line, making them the second-largest impoverished population in the world behind India. The prosperity we once enjoyed in the late nineties and early 2000s is now a thing of the past. Skyscrapers that adorned the streets of Abuja now have their paint peeling at the edges. Government offices now have their windows and doors permanently open because there is no electricity and diesel has become as scarce as gold bars. Even the almighty Jollof rice that we once boasted about in Nigeria has become tasteless. Because how can one make delicious Jollof rice when tomatoes and tattasai have become as rare as diamonds? A large basket of tomatoes now cost N150,000! Not to mention fish, meat and other orisirisi??\\n', '\\n', 'Have you attended a wedding or funeral recently?

Yet, the speed and alacrity with which members of the green and red chambers championed the change of our national anthem left us dazzled.

Nigerians have shown no desire to learn the old lyrics and frankly cannot be bothered.   Nigeria continues to face many social and economic challenges that include insecurity such as banditry and kidnappings especially in the northwest region, continued insurgency by terrorist groups in the north-east, and separatist agitations in the south-east. Learning the lyrics to a song written by our colonial masters eons ago, especially with the memories it brings, is certainly not at the top of my to do list.\\n', '\\n', 'Instead, I would suggest we find a magic key that can be used to shut the door to past and throw that key into the Atlantic Ocean. \\n', '\\n', 'No more dredging up old stuff. \\n', '\\n', 'Progression not regression.

How can KTSG helps them? - State Living Standard Survey (SLSS) expected to be conducted by KBS, from time to time, in conjunction with relevant development partners, is an important statistical technique or tool of gathering this information to guide poverty eradication programmes of KTSG - as it's now, anti poverty programmes in Katsina State are being administered nearly blindly!\\n\", '\\n', '3.

That seems hypocritical.\\n', '\\n', 'Nigerians are no doubt men of faith who believe so much in prayers.

But how much have we achieved in Nigeria with prayers?\\n', '\\n', 'There is a popular quote that says: “If you fail to prepare, you have prepared to fail”.

Not even Agriculture is transformed even with the fertile lands. We dare not ask them to account for their deeds as leaders but pray for them. So, what do you want God to do for you?\\n', '\\n', 'Someone is sick in our \"sick hospitals\" and we turn to prayer while the leaders go to London and Dubai for Medicare. Our education system is in a state of emergency they refused to declare while the leaders take their kids abroad to be educated. The roads are getting scarier to travel due to insecurities and they are building airports to ease their movement. The more we pray, the more things are getting worse and we are still praying rather than taking action. We so much believe that prayers can change our situations to the extent that a whole industrial estate in Lagos is now converted to a Church estate and you can hardly pass a street without Churches and Mosques.\\n', '\\n', \"Nigerians (educated) now go to the former industrial estate that used to provide jobs, to make offerings and prayers for jobs. Where will the job come from? At the time our industries were closing down and religious houses were springing up everywhere, an Arab Sheikh was busy working and transforming Dubai into a first World City. He didn't wait for prayers to make that happen. Now, Dubai is the new hideout for our leaders and their family. One of our prominent politicians has made Dubai his abode for now.\\n\", '\\n', 'Our leaders actually know that we love to pray, and while they are looting, they are encouraging us to pray more and even giving us religious houses instead of industries. In 2000 during my NYSC, the Chairman of the LG where I served funded people from the LG to Hajj and built mosques around the village. The people were hailing the Chairman as they considered that a laudable project. Meanwhile, the LG had no clean water for drinking.

We were praying for their success while they played around with policies that have messed up the system. Within the last 6 years, we watch as the cost of basic needs doubled with devalued income, and purchasing power has reduced by half. Over the last 2 years, the price of basic commodities has increased monthly. Our prayers could not stop that. Our prayers could not stop the trial-and-error policies. That should tell you that we are doing something wrong and not about prayers.\\n', '\\n', \"If a country is built with prayer, Nigeria would have been one of the best countries in the world, but it is not. Our prayers would have made Ajaokuta Steel Complex work and produce thousands of jobs. But No country is developed with prayers and surviving on prayers.

A patriotic leader won't leave the public hospitals sick to patronize hospitals abroad.\\n\", '\\n', 'Some schools of thought believe that it is the \"Will of God\" that we are where we are today with terrible leadership. But how come that people who don\\'t pray much have better leadership and better conditions while we who are prayer warriors have got terrible leaders.

Is it actually the \"Will of God\" or our making?\\n', '\\n', \"For my few years in Europe, I can't remember a meeting I attended that was started with prayers. However, the meetings were purposeful, sincerely conducted, and had a target with deliverables. Results were surely obtained within a set timeline. In Nigeria, we have a tradition of starting every meeting with prayers but with little or no deliverables. Is it that our prayers are not working or we are doing something wrong or we are actually supposed to act to change our situations?\\n\", '\\n', 'A ruthless man who has made some money invested the money in politics and pulled all the strings (the good the bad the ugly) to get an elected position or political appointment to make more money and you are praying for the political businessman to have mercy?

And you are praying to God to change what you already know and have the power to change?\\n', '\\n', 'When God created us, He endowed us with senses, intellect, and divine guidance, and then a gift of FREEWILL. God has given us the ability to identify our problems, and the free will to choose what to do about them.

To start with, Dangote is a spoilt monopolistic child who is throwing preemptive ejaculative tantrums. He can't survive without government's support and the privilege of monopolies Despite the fact that he is paying about $1.5/MMBTU which is one of the cheapest rates (GBI) in the country,  he is owing the IOCs millions of dollars in gas payment arrears,  the payment though indexed to dollars is in Naira. We need to understand this Dangote's antecedent.\\n\", '\\n', \"2. On the accusation levelled against NNPCL, there is no doubt that this entity is a cess-pool of corruption, but on this particular issue, Dangote is just a narcissist who is gaslighting the agency. Let me state the facts here. It should interest you to note that Nigeria's daily average crude oil production is about 1.25 million barrels of crude oil per day, given that Nigeria has a 60/40% JV arrangement with the IOCs save for the now departed Shell with 55/45% equity distribution. Accounting for the PSC, Nigeria should be getting around 750,000 barrels of oil per day. Kindly note that Dangote's refinery needs about 650,000 per day. However, because NNPCL and the Nigerian government have not been funding their share of the cost of producing oil, this volume is always lesser than the quoted amount above. Buhari executed 7 forward sale agreement, that is, borrowed money and used our crude oil for several years as repayment,  a good example is the Afrexim bank loan of $3.3b dollars that Tinubu took last August,  the crude oil commitment at about 11.58% interest is 90,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Given all these crude oil deductions, Nigeria gets about 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day.  This is what Tinubu sells for about $16 million dollars at $80/barrels as the main source of dollars for 213 million Nigerians, out of this money, there is a backdoor subsidy of about $8m per day. Now let me ask this simple question: Where does Dangote expect NNPCL to get the 650,000 barrels to give him for his refinery? If Tinubu gives him the 200,000 barrels, where do we get money to import drugs, buy cars, import diesel,  run government? Despite the fact that NNPCL owns 20% of Dangote's refinery equity,  NNPCL decided to sell some of their crude oil to him, Dangote however refused to provide a Letter of Credit (LOC) for the payment since 27th June 2024, he has been incurring a $65,000 daily demurrage. They issued him a load and anchor permit and not a load and sail clearance.  Now, where is NNPCL fault on this issue?  This same Dangote imported WTI crude from USA, he incurred 4 weeks of demurrage because he couldn't pay for the crude oil. These are all logical and not emotional arguments. \\n\", '\\n', \"3. Regarding accusations against the IOCs, they are bending over backward to accommodate his request, but as usual, he is a spoilt Oliver twist. IOCs have SPA ( Special Purchase Agreement) commitment spanning 10 to 20 years with international buyers, there is penalty for default of these contracts, despite these constraints,  one of the IOCs had to incorporate another trading company in London at the cost of millions of dollars to sell crude oil to Dangote. Dangote's ship arrived at one of the IOCs export terminals, loaded crude oil, but once again, could not provide an LOC (letter of credit) since 29th June 2024, demurrage is ongoing as we speak. Dangote is asking for an additional $6 per barrel discount and wants to pay in Naira. No one will sell crude oil to Dangote in Naira because oil blocks are awarded in Dollars, signature bonus are paid in dollars, seismic survey and aeromagnetic survey with gravity data are acquired in dollars, interpretation of the data is 80% dollars,  wells are drilled in dollars, production facilities are constructed in dollars. Even Tompolo surveillance contracts are largely dollar denominated. Someone should please make me understand why they would sell to him in Naira? The PIA act permits payment in Naira or dollars, but given my explanation here, who would sell in Naira ?\\n\", '\\n', '4. Regarding the so-called importation of dirty diesel, did we start importing diesel in Nigeria in April when dangote started producing diesel ? We should be able to apply some logic here. Have we not been importing diesel since ? Why is Dangote shouting now? He simply wants monopoly. Why are all our generators not dead all these while since we have been importing diesel? This is common sense now !!! And, I am disappointed that none of the lawmakers asked this simple logical question. What does Dangote want to happen to the import license that has been importing diesel for us for more than 40 years? Should they all cease to exist from April 2024? These are questions that the lawmakers are not asking.\\n', '\\n', \"5. On a final note, the PIA was 20 years late, investments have moved elsewhere, people played politics with it, and that's why the IOCs are leaving. Shell, ExxonMobil, and Agip have all left. It's only Chevron and Total remaining. If they make too much trouble for them because of Dangote,  they will leave as well. Your corrupt politicians would buy them and turn them to another Ajaokuta. \\n\", '\\n', '6. Dangote is looking for another monopoly.

Dangote refinery is the largest investment by a Nigerian in Nigeria in perhaps our entire history. The investment is valued at $20 billion. The land purchase alone cost $100 million, with another $420 million spent on revamping and reconstruction of the swamp to make it viable for the construction of the refinery. That is close to a trillion naira in land preparation and pre-construction expenditure. A port had to be built to accommodate the size of the refinery's equipment and parts, including building a power plant with the capacity of supplying 1500 MW of electricity. Also, a highway had to be constructed for the delivery of equipments from the port to the refinery, along with the development of 125 kms of pipeline for the delivery of crude oil to the refinery. The conceptualisation of the project was done over 15 years ago, with its construction taking atleast 7 to 8 years. Industry experts worldwide had warned Alh. Aliko Dangote that it was a crazy project, he admits. He did see the crazy it was when he started, as the challenges ballooned in number and size. Indeed he was 'crazier' enough to accomplish its development. The real crazy now are the impediments and bottlenecks he is facing, as he battles to actualize the aspiration of solving Nigeria's perennial problem of importing petroleum products, as an oil producing country.\\n\", '\\n', \"At first it was the International Oil Companies, IOCs, refusing to sell crude to the Dangote refinery, or selling at about $6 more than global prices. The NUPRC, Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission had to wade in to secure oil supply for the refinery. Then oil dealers were at it, charging as high as $4 as agency fees, again, against global practices. The government had to step up against the IOCs and it seemed that it was a resolved issue. Then came a fire incident in the refinery which has caused atleast a month's delay in the production of PMS, known as petrol, which is what the Nigerian populace is earnestly yearning for, from the refinery. The entry of Dangote refinery into the diesel market has caused for a reduction of diesel prices by about 60%. This has definitely upset the diesel importation industry and has bloated the number of individuals and cabals coming against the Dangote refinery. Despite all these challenges, the refinery seemed to be on course to deliver petrol to the Nigerian market. But the 'crazy' in the industry has probably just set in again, and said, not so fast Dangote!\\n\", '\\n', \"Very scathing remarks, uncharacteristic of an umpire, were made by the CEO of the Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Agency, NMDPRA, Engr. Farouk Ahmed, which cast aspersions on the standards, productivity and even the viability of the Dangote refinery. He castigated the Sulphur content of the diesel from Dangote refinery, putting it at between 650-1200 ppm. A visit by the Speaker of the House of Representatives on a fact finding mission confirmed that it was at 87.6 ppm. Dangote clarified that they were on their way to declaring a content of 10 ppm. Further testing from other filling stations proved that Dangote refinery's diesel was far more superior in sulphur content. There's also the other parameter of the flashpoint, with Dangote's diesel recording 90° celsius, compared to other marketers whose product recorded between 40° to 70° celsius. The recommended standard is 66° celsius, further proving that Dangote's diesel was the best in the market. The Dangote lab for the testing was accredited by the same NMDPRA in March, 2024. NMDPRA knows that as a new refinery, the earliest stages of production would definitely have a high sulphur content compared to subsequent or continued production. \\n\", '\\n', \"The CEO of NMDPRA also said that the refinery was at 45% completion. As a regulator, he is well aware of the stages involved in the completion of the refinery, where all the products it is designed to produce, can be actually processed and produced by the refinery. For now, two major products are set to be available to the Nigerian market, with one already in use. It is supposed to be in stages. So what was the statement meant to achieve? He also called the refinery a monopoly, while infact, several other modular refineries have been licensed, with quite a number in production. He lamented that Dangote wanted fuel imports stopped. But isn't that the desire of every Nigerian? Well of course minus those that make a kill, importing petroleum products, killing our local refineries. NNPC Ltd. says atleast one of their refineries would be producing petroleum products by September this year. In a market where there are multiple producers, how does Dangote refinery amount to a monopoly? He also complained that Dangote's refinery is a threat to the energy security of the country. Under the importation regime, we have suffered 3 fuel scarcities in the last 6 months alone. So where is the security in importation? Are we not better off with a steady supply from Dangote? Afterall the refinery is building a storage capacity to have almost a billion litres of petrol in storage. \\n\", '\\n', \"The CEO's remarks are in bad light and look like an attempt to demarket the Dangote refinery. Unfortunately it has backfired and has pitched the Nigerian people to stand solidly behind Dangote. It is rare for the people to rally behind a super rich man like Aliko, but what the refinery stands for, is much larger than Aliko Dangote. It stands for the industrialisation of Africa. It stands to change our fortunes, in terms of the hardship and exploitation that we have suffered, over a product in our backyard, that has refused to be available in our front yard. Those comments paint the CEO of NMDPRA as one against the success story of the refinery, and the solutions it stands to bring to one of our biggest problems. The gains are too numerous to mention. From fx gains, to employment, to ending scarcities and black marketing.. there are far too many merits to this project, than the cries of monopoly and what have you. We'd rather be monopolised by our own citizen, than continue to be the dumping ground of oil dealers around the world, that have made our country their cash cow, milking us as they please. It looks like Dangote's fuel will be cheaper, just like his diesel, and some dealers don't want that to happen. With those statements by the umpire, investors are being pushed away. Steel investments by the Dangote group have now been abandoned due to those unsavory statements. What does it tell other investors around the world about us?\\n\", '[22/07/2024, 08:34:31] ~\\u202fMUHAMMAD ABDULLAHI  LITI📚: \\u200eMuhammad Sunusi Waziri added ~\\u202fMUHAMMAD ABDULLAHI  LITI📚\\n', \"[22/07/2024, 08:47:52] Malam Muhammad Uncle: It's evident that the government is frustrating full take off and success of the refinery and also of the opinion that we better be monopolized by own industrialist than the retrogressive western world that always become a threat to our progress as nation.\\n\", '[22/07/2024, 08:55:48] ~\\u202fYahaya Sarki 📜: The monopoly allegation is one of the \"vested interests\" propaganda stunts.

I followed this up with more than half a dozen columns on the same theme.\\n', '\\n', \"When you remove subsidies from an all-important product like petrol that literally regulates every facet of life in a country like Nigeria, which also has the dubious honor of being in perpetual competition with India for the status of the world's poverty capital, and then follow it up with a massive devaluation of the national currency even when the country is hopelessly import-dependent, you unleash existential demons that compel vast swaths of people to choose between life and death. \\n\", '\\n', 'False assurances that the mass agony in the country is only temporary, or that the pains people are grappling with are mere precursors to future gains, or even that there is light at the end of the tunnel only aggravate people’s angst. There are two reasons for this.\\n', '\\n', 'One, most people know that based on past experiences in Nigeria (notably during IBB’s ruinous SAP, which Tinubu merely repurposed and renamed) and elsewhere in the developing world where the IMF and the World Bank dictate economic policies, there has never been a single example of these sorts of pains ever transforming into gains for the masses of the people.\\n', '\\n', 'Second, people outside the circles of power and privilege realize that the pains are being borne only by the poor. Tinubu, for example, bought a new presidential jet worth millions of dollars even before the spineless National Assembly had a chance to rubber-stamp it, as is now their wont, among other profligate expenditures amid a biting economic downturn. \\n', '\\n', ' People who are visiting darkness on the poor in the name of a deferred light at the end of the tunnel are glowing in incandescent bulbs of illumination. And the people are intelligent enough to know that what awaits them at the end of this disconsolate tunnel isn’t light. It’s an inferno. It’s a dreary snake pit of doom and gloom.\\n', '\\n', 'When people come to this realization, no one needs to “sponsor” them to protest. The pangs of hunger they feel is sufficient to sponsor them to protest. The sensation of hopelessness that overcomes them is a bigger motive force for protest than the political machinations of any politician.\\n', '\\n', 'But even if it’s true that opposition politicians are taking advantage of the mass discontent in the country to cripple the government and delegitimize it for their self-interest, that’s not illegal. It’s an intrinsic element of democracies for opposition parties to seize on the missteps of incumbents to displace them.\\n', '\\n', 'President Tinubu is in power today precisely because he mastered the art of instrumentalizing the missteps of incumbents to advance his political aspirations. As recently as 2012, he “sponsored” a disruptive protest against former President Goodluck Jonathan that led to the deaths of protesters—for precisely what he is doing to Nigerians now. \\n', '\\n', 'No amount of persuasion or financial inducement of traditional rulers, religious clerics, union leaders, or activists will get people to make peace with needless suffering occasioned by a self-centered, hard-hearted implementation of vicious economic policies that snuff the life out of the people. Even if the planned protests are aborted, the predictable is only being postponed.\\n', '\\n', 'The only way Tinubu can retain legitimacy and earn the trust of the people is to reverse the deep, stinging hurt his policies have caused to the vast majority of our people. People are no longer interested in progress or the renewal of hope. They just want Tinubu to take them back to where he met them, which was not an enviable state. And that’s not too much to ask.\\n', '\\n', 'In a February 10, 2024, column titled “Hunger Protests: Why Tinubu Can’t Govern Like Buhari,” I said the spontaneous, hunger-induced eruption of seething communal anger in Minna, Suleja, Kano, and Osogbo were “a warning sign” that Tinubu couldn’t afford to ignore. He ignored it. \\n', '\\n', 'He is probably following the Buhari template of enacting unpopular policies and relying on the blind support of his worshipers to shield him from the consequences of his actions. But Tinubu has no such following, and I am glad he doesn’t, which is why I would hate for someone like Peter Obi or Rabiu Kwankwaso to be president.\\n', '\\n', ' They are political cult leaders with unthinking, fanatical followers who lose their damned minds if you as much utter the mildest critical remark about their gods, however factual it may be. Like Buharists, they have abdicated their senses to their political gods.\\n', '\\n', ' I reproduce here a portion of the column to remind Tinubu why he can’t benefit from the kind of immunity Buhari enjoyed:\\n', '\\n', ' “Had the current president been Muhammadu Buhari and not Bola Ahmed Tinubu, chances are that the worst that would happen amid the adversity people are going through now would be suppressed, barely audible murmurs. It’s because Buhari is a political cult leader with a firm grip on his followers who worship him and surrender responsibility for their lives over to him. Tinubu has no such appeal.\\n', '\\n', '“A psychologist by the name of Steve Taylor came up with a concept he called ‘abdication syndrome,’ which he said disposes people to invest total, child-like trust in a political figure, a cult leader, an opinion molder, etc. in ways that mimic how children idealize and idolize their parents as unblemished paragons of perfection. \\n', '\\n', '“According to Taylor, ‘abdication syndrome stems from the unconscious desire of some people to return to a state of early childhood, when their parents were infallible, omnipotent figures who controlled their lives and protected them from the world. They’re trying to rekindle that childhood state of unconditional devotion and irresponsibility.’\\n', '\\n', '“Buhari is lucky to benefit from abdication syndrome in Muslim northern Nigeria, broadly conceived, which explains why he got away with murder for eight years. When he increased petrol prices by a steep margin in 2016, for instance, there were protests in Kano, Bauchi, and other places in SUPPORT of the increase and AGAINST people who planned to protest the increase. Nigeria had never seen anything like that before.\\n', '\\n', '“Even protests against the unabating descent of northern Nigeria into a theater of bloodshed and abduction on Buhari’s watch provoked counter protests from people who have abdicated the use of their brains in the service of Buhari.\\n', '\\n', '“Tinubu not only does not have the benefit of abdication syndrome anywhere in Nigeria, but he also has the misfortune of having to contend with a peculiar character of Muslim northern Nigeria: we feel the pain of, and react violently to, bad policies only when the policies are hatched and executed by people who have no filiation with our natal region.\\n', '\\n', '“It’s no surprise that the hunger protests against the Tinubu administration started from and spread in the North.\\n', '\\n', '“A powerful indication of Tinubu’s lack of firm emotional support base emerged when Osun, his state of birth where he lost the last presidential election to PDP’s Atiku Abubakar, became the first southern state to join the hunger protests. Should the resistance to his punishingly heartless neoliberal economic policies ignite a nationwide convulsion, the Southwest is unlikely to constitute itself as his bulwark.\\n', '\\n', '“In fact, I hazard a guess that should Tinubu’s unfeeling policies activate the sort of destabilizing national upheaval that we saw in 2012 during Goodluck Jonathan’s administration, the Southwest won’t be aloof. It is likely to join in.\\n', '\\n', '“And, of course, Tinubu is deeply unpopular in the Southeast, the South-south, and Christian northern Nigeria. In other words, Tinubu is essentially floundering into the most treacherous of social quicksands.\\n', '\\n', '“His only fortification against danger is not just good governance but compassionate governance. The release of thousands of metric tons of grains is a good first step, but it’s not nearly enough to stem the tide of mass rebellion that is brewing in the country. At best, it will only delay the inevitable.\\n', '\\n', '“The truth is that Nigeria can’t survive a total withdrawal of petroleum subsidies without an adequate, systematic, well-planned public transportation system. To do away with petrol subsidies, the government must first create conditions where car ownership and patronage of commercial transportation are a luxury.”\\n', '\\n', '[https://www.farooqkperogi.com/2024/07/protests-tinubus-real-troubles-are-just.html](https://www.farooqkperogi.com/2024/07/protests-tinubus-real-troubles-are-just.html\\n', \"[27/07/2024, 22:48:59] Malam Muhammad Uncle: @2348038473713 Sir!

The good part of it is that you have also proffered solutions to address it which I totally agree with you. Furthermore, this is can also be achievable if we add it to educating our people most especially at grass root level of the need to for birth control to address the number of kids that always hawk the streets and begging people and also tarnishing our image.

I had composed a virulent rejoinder and somehow I didn't get down to scribbling it out. Then I heard his brother reminding him of the number of children from their own father's house and I was pacified. But then I've had cause to reflect on what he said in the light of the riots that have broken out in the North. The looting, attack on public and private property, burning of both public and private property, bombs going of, along with the robbing and defacing of a mosque and of course a church too; I saw the worst of arewa on full public glare. Gov. Fayose's words haunted my thoughts and I felt the sweats of shame fill my forehead. Have we become so barbaric and out of control? The arewa that we are all so proud to call home? \\n\", '\\n', 'What was on display is just about an accurate illustration of how our society has fallen off from the moral and religious values we so pride ourselves in. Our decorum has hit the floor, the corruption in our society has hit the roof, our moral values have evaporated into thin air, and we are in our worst cultural decline. The culture of Islam that has guided our people has fast become an identity only on our lips and not in our deeds. We say the salam on our lips and carry war in our hearts. We have abandoned the ways of Allah and the teachings of the prophet of Allah, SAW, and have erected devil workshops in each and every of our backyards. We have bred terrorists who maim and kill with reckless abandon. We have groomed an army of terrorist informants and terrorist apologists, and today, even some lecturers in higher institutions are part of the terror trade. Family members plot with terrorists in favor of ransom. Babies are dumped in university hostels and gutters around town. Our men and women are into intoxicants obtained from syrups and other harmful drugs. Prostitution and homosexuality is almost in every home. Our leaders steal publicly and are celebrated publicly. Our traditional institutions have long been desecrated and are now less than even the ceremonial structures they were reduced to ages ago. Our Ulama are facing their own desecration and disrespect from the umma. Our leadership crew is rudderless with everyone trying to steer himself into one advantageous position or the other. Our elders lack the altruism that was handed over to them by their forebears. We have derailed far away from the cloud of providence that used to guide and protect us. \\n', '\\n', \"The arewa landscape is littered with thousands of ex-this and ex-that. Presidents, Ministers, Governors, Defence Chiefs, Permanent Secretaries, Directors, Heads of MDAs, and ofcourse business moguls. But these are only litters as they have not nourished the landscape altogether, to build the much needed prosperity for the arewa citizen. They are few and far between ivory towers that have not given back to the society in general. If they have, it has not been adequate. Northern elite have watched the decay and rot in arewa forment into the present day astronomical proportion. The North has had its fair share of power, including in the last 8 years, yet the landscape has become more impoverished. How? By building few and far between ivory towers only. The remaining terrain remains famished. The millions of out of school children, millions of unskilled youth, and millions of unemployed youth are becoming an army without a commander in chief. This uncontrollable army will not watch those ivory towers revel in glory while they live in squalor. They will bring them down along with every other thing else. To them, raising Russian flags is some kind of identity, as they aren't even aware of the ramifications of it all.\\n\", '\\n', 'Is arewa going to conscientiously wake up to this challenge, and begin the reform of its society and its people? Do we still have leaders from within us, that can rally round, round up our human and capital resources, and harness them for the betterment of arewa in general? Are we going to holistically and transparently fight terrorism or are we going to keep covering for each other and continue deceiving ourselves? We have a list of our problems, alongside a list of answers too. When are we going to cross-match them? If we do not get rid of these self inflicted problems, then they will be the end of us. Are we ready, or is life for the arewa elite just about power and self aggrandisement? Of what use is the power if it cannot be useful to the people? Our most pertinent problems have not been solved by power, so it must be solved by something else. Now is the time. \\n', '\\n', 'If the Northern elite cannot put things aright in arewa, no one can do it for the region. Our destiny is in our hands. For decades we have wandered like a sheperdless flock, grazing freely over lush plainlands, without a care in the world. On our way back, it is not so lush. It is time to be creative and more productive. Socialism is being taken over by capitalism the world over. So only the strong survive and only the wise excel. The siesta has got to end. The slumber has gone on for too long. It is time to wake up to our responsibilities as leaders of this rudderless flock, thanks to our mistakes and mis-steps. The tough economic decisions are being faced by every region of the federation. Still, food is cheaper in the North than down south which is a no brainer. We are badly hit because we are least prepared. We are least prepared because we have been in slumber for too long. Wake up arewa before it is too late. If there is another wave of these riots, there will be no arewa left. If we do not stand up to help ourselves, even God will not bother. Or are we waiting for PBAT to become that Northern leader that will salvage the North, which all our previous leaders were not able to do? \\n', '\\n', 'Yahoo Mail: Search, organise, conquer\\n', '\\u200e[07/08/2024, 17:49:39] ~\\u202fHassan Muhammad: \\u200eimage omitted\\n', '[07/08/2024, 17:51:58] ~\\u202fMagajin Magaji: he called me 35 minute ago, but i did not picked\\n', '\\u200e[07/08/2024, 17:52:15] Moh Sayftea: \\u200eimage omitted\\n', '[07/08/2024, 17:52:22] Moh Sayftea: Someone is trying to scam people oh\\n', '[07/08/2024, 17:52:37] Moh Sayftea: Immediately naga Whatsapp dina sun turo wani code\\n', '[07/08/2024, 17:52:49] Moh Sayftea: Please ya all should have  2-step verifications\\n', '[07/08/2024, 17:53:12] ~\\u202fHassan Muhammad: He is trying to hijack your WhatsApp\\n', '[07/08/2024, 17:55:08] Moh Sayftea: Wlh Allah\\n', '[07/08/2024, 17:55:13] Moh Sayftea: He called back i blocked him\\n', '[07/08/2024, 21:03:56] MC Bahaushe: FORTY REASONS TO READ BOOKS\\n', '\\n', '1.

Go to a fruit seller near you and request for papaya seeds. They usually throw them away. There’s an average of 400 seeds in a pod. Collect as many as they can give you. \\n', '\\n', '2. Soak the seeds in water for 24 hours. Throw away the floating seeds and keep the ones that sunk to the bottom. They’re likely to be more viable\\n', '\\n', '3. Collect used pure water sachets and plant  the seeds. Two or three in a sachet. \\n', '\\n', '4. The seeds will germinate in 1-2 weeks. Leave them for two weeks. Then sort the female seedlings from the male. You don’t have to wait until they flower to tell them apart. Only few people know this trick and they guard it as a trade secret. I’m going to tell you today. Check my other post to see how. \\n', '\\n', '5. After about eight weeks, your seedlings are ready to be transplanted into the ground. \\n', '\\n', '6. Each hole should be dug 2 feet deep and 2 feet wide. \\n', '\\n', '7. Get a 4-gallon bucket of well decomposed manure and mix with the soil. If you can lay your hands on rabbits manure you can use it fresh and not wait for it to decompose because it’s cold manure. \\n', '\\n', '8. Plant the seedlings two meters apart. This means that you can accommodate 100 trees in a small space. \\n', '\\n', '9. Water and weed when needed. You can start harvesting in the 7th or 8th month. Harvest the fruits when you see yellow lines. \\n', '\\n', '10. Each tree will give you N30,000. That’s N3 million for 100 trees. \\n', '\\n', '11. Now that you’ve grown your own seeds, use the seeds from the best fruits to scale your business. \\n', '\\n', 'Summary: This guide shows you how to start your tree plantation with no money down.

this may equally also means, Gold and Silver are used as a means to an end - they are simply used as a means of an exchange - as money - and not an end themselves - the end being arriving at a Zakat Nisab or Zakat Threshold and to me this therefore means, if what we call money changes, then, all our benchmarks to our former money must equally be changed!\\n\", '\\n', \"The challenge now in our contemporary times, is the fact that, neither Gold nor Silver is used anywhere, in the world, including in Nigeria, as money, at one hand and neither Gold nor Silver, was used anywhere, in the world, including Nigeria, to back any money, at another hand - in our contemporary times, fiat monetary system is fortunately or unfortunately used as money, which is backed by neither Gold nor Silver, but only the promise of the Central Monetary Authorities to accept them as a legal tender - this therefore means, it's high time, we look at the possibility of reinventing the wheel of Zakat Nisab, from the use of either these classical Silver or Gold, to something that may be really, in conformity with our contemporary monetary realities, at one hand and with view to circumvent the above mentioned challenges, inconsistencies, arbitrariness and uncertainties, with regards to the determination of Zakat Nisab, using either Gold or Silver!\\n\", '\\n', 'If I may humbly suggest, such macroeconomic variables, as the following, can be used to benchmark Zakat Nisab in our contemporary times:\\n', '\\n', '# Islamic Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the sum of adjusted Shariah compliant goods and services produced, within the borders of country - a percentage of GDP or Per Capita Income at PPP (2010 Prices) can be used to arrive at the Zakat Benchmark and the Zakat Rate can be applied to it;\\n', '\\n', '# the total Broad Money Supply in the economy - money are supplied and withdrawn in an economy and in tandem with the performance of the economy - this is what Monetary Policy is all about and the adjusted Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) published quarterly, by the Monetary Authorities, can equally be benchmarked;\\n', '\\n', '# Annual Fiscal Budget of the Government - the sum total of the expenditures and incomes of the government, for a given fiscal year can equally be used!\\n', '\\n', '# A composite macroeconomic variables, consisting of the above and many more can equally be used!\\n', '\\n', 'The good thing about the above mentioned macroeconomic measures is that, because they are all linked to the local economy, if the local economy expands, then, more Zakat would be paid and if the economy contrasts, then, less Zakat would be paid -

Kabiru el-Hussain Rumah\\n', 'Jakadan Rumah \\n', '\\n', 'No doubt Zakat and Waqf Administration, in Nigeria, especially, if effectively, efficiently and economically reformed and transformed, by adopting the following twelve (12) national and global best practices, can go along way, in ensuring and assuring that, Zakat and Waqf alone, have significantly complimented, if not completely overtaken the financing of education, healthcare and social welfare of the people, from the governments of Nigeria and across all levels of government and governance, especially now that, there is a global political yearnings and aspirations, for both lean government and lean governance, at one hand and Simple, Moral, Accountable, Responsible and Transparent (SMART) government and governance, at another hand! \\n', '\\n', 'The following are the twelve (12) suggested Zakat and Waqf Reforms urgently needed in the Zakat and Waqf Institutions of Nigeria:\\n', '\\n', '*1. Reform Number: 1 - the need to make separate and distinct Zakat and Waqf OPERATIONS, from Zakat and Waqf REGULATIONS!*\\n', '\\n', 'The above therefore means, there should be a separate organisation, in each applicable State of Nigeria, that REGULATES the administration of both Zakat and Waqf and other aspects and dimensions of the Islamic Social Finance (ISF), in the State and this organisation should be separate and distinct, from other Public and Private Zakat and Waqf Institutions, that actually engage in the actual OPERATIONS of Zakat and Waqf and other aspects ISF in such State! \\n', '\\n', 'The current practice whereby Zakat and Waqf Commissions, Boards, Committees and Authorities, in Nigeria are both Zakat and Waqf OPERATORS and at the same time Zakat and Waqf REGULATORS, in almost all the States of Nigeria, had fortunately or unfortunately, contributed, in the poor development of the Zakat and Waqf Sector and hence among the reasons, why the potentials and promises of Zakat and Waqf are little felt, in most of these States of Nigeria!\\n', '\\n', 'It may interest some of us to know that, one reason, for the rapid development of Islamic Commercial Finance (ICF), in Nigeria, is the deliberate and strategic separation of the OPERATIONS and REGULATIONS of ICF - the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) and its statutory agencies, such as CBN, NDIC, SEC, NAICOM etc being the REGULATORS, while the private sector being the OPERATORS of ICF - I believe if the same approach is adopted to the Islamic Social Finance (ISF), especially the Zakat and Waqf Sector, the Sector would definitely be transformed, from a dirty jewels, to one that glitters and for the benefits of all and sundry, in Nigeria!\\n', '\\n', '*2. Reform Number: 2 - the need to make separate and distinct Zakat and Waqf MANAGEMENT, from the Zakat and Waqf GOVERNANCE, in Nigeria respectively!*\\n', '\\n', 'Zakat and Waqf Institutions are undoubtedly a trust based institutions and hence, there is an urgent needs, to ensure another tier or level of accountability, to the administration of Zakat and Waqf, through making a Zakat Management Committee (ZMC) separate and distinct, from the Zakat Governance Board (ZGB) - the former being accountable to the latter - this is with view, not only to improve transparency and accountability - the hallmarks of Zakat and Waqf administration - but equally to counter the Agency Problem associated with Zakat and Waqf administration in Nigeria - Agency Problem occurs, when Zakat Management Committees (ZMC) pursue other personal goals, apart from the goals of the Zakat Payers (Muzakkis) and Waqf Founders (Wakifs) respectively!\\n', '\\n', 'The current practices, in most States of Nigeria, whereby the Executives of the Zakat and Waqf Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees, are the REGULATORS and the same time MANAGERS and GOVERNING BOARDS of such Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees, had actually left much to be desired and asked, from such Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees and in terms of such good governance virtues, as accountability, integrity, morality, responsibility and transparency!\\n', '\\n', \"*3. Reform Number: 3 - on the need for a dedicated Shari'ah Supervisory Boards (SSBs), for the Zakat and Waqf Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees in Nigeria!*\\n\", '\\n', 'I always ask whom it may concern, on why do we have a FORMAL Advisory Committees of Experts (ACEs), another name for SSBs, for Islamic Commercial Finance Institutions (ICFIs), but not for Islamic Social Finance Institutions (ISFIs), such as Zakat and Waqf Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees, in Nigeria and with view to ensure that, the Shariah Governance of such Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees and in terms of not only Zakat and Waqf administrations, but equally, in terms of their other corporate activities, such as recruitments, internal controls, promotions, appointments, social responsibilities, cultures, public relations etc that requires Shariah Review!\\n', '\\n', \"If ICFIs can have SSBs/ACEs peculiar to their legal form and character, I personally see no reason why ISFIs cannot have a FORMAL and publicly known SSBs/ACEs, for their legal form and character also, especially looking at the strategic roles SSBs/ACEs can significantly play, in not only ensuring the Shari'ah Governance (and hence reducing Shariah Governance Risks of these ISFIs), but equally, in boosting the confidence of the general public, towards such Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees, as the case may be - indeed, Zakat and Waqf Institutions like I said earlier are trust based institutions and hence people must trust and have confidence, in them, for them to function effectively, efficiently and economically!\\n\", '\\n', '*4. Reform Number: 4 - the need for Islamic Poverty Line (IPL), for Zakat and Waqf Administration, in Nigeria!*\\n', '\\n', 'I always ask whom it may concern, on how do Zakat and Waqf Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees, in Nigeria OBJECTIVELY and certainly not SUBJECTIVELY know, who is actually a Poor and the Needy and as the two (2) among the eight (8) Quranic Beneficiaries of Zakat (Mustahiqs)? And I am yet to get a reliable answer on this!\\n', '\\n', \"The above therefore means, it's high time, Zakat and Waqf Institutions, in Nigeria, both public and private, learn to develop a quantitative Shariah compliant Poverty Line and in light of Islamic conceptions of who is actually a poor and how is poor different from the Needy and with view to guide them, in not only identifying a real poor, but equally, in the distributions of the Zakat and Waqf products and services, to them effectively, efficiently and economically - IPL can be developed just like the Conventional Poverty Line (CPL), using either incomes, expenditures, capabilities, energy intake or other poverty measures or approaches, as the case may be!\\n\", '\\n', 'The above is where Zakat and Waqf Institutions, in Nigeria, can strategically benchmark or collaborate, with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of Nigeria and State Bureau of Statistics (SBS) of the States of Nigeria, as the case may be - I know reliably NBS and Kaduna State Bureau of Statistics (KSBS), for example, have a robust statistical frameworks and methodologies, for not only measuring poverty and vulnerability, but equally, in computing the National Poverty Line (NPL) for Nigeria and State Poverty Line (SPL), for Kaduna State respectively - Zakat and Waqf Institutions can benchmark all these statistical techniques and tools, with view to develop an Islamic Poverty Line (IPL) and with view to guide their administration of Zakat and Waqf, in their respective States!\\n', '\\n', '*5. Reform Number: 5 - the need to develop Zakat and Waqf Databases, with view to improve Zakat and Waqf Administration, in Nigeria!*\\n', '\\n', 'There should be a central Zakat and Waqf Databases, in the applicable States of Nigeria, and for both Zakat Payers (Muzakkis) and Zakat Recipients (Mustahiqs), at one hand and Waqf Founders (Wakifs) and Waqf Beneficiaries (Mauqoof Alaihim), at another hand and with view to avert the ugly trends of both Double Zakat (DZ), at one hand and Double Zakat Beneficiary (DZB), at another hand and as well as with view to improve the economy, effectiveness and efficiency of Zakat and Waqf administration in Nigeria! \\n', '\\n', 'The above is where Zakat and Waqf Institutions, in Nigeria, can benchmark such good managerial practices of our contemporary Tax Administration and Administrators respectively, and such as Tax Identification Number (TIN), for both Zakat Identification Number (ZIN) and Waqf Identification Number (WIN), at one hand and Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC), for Zakat Clearance Certificate (ZCC) and Waqf Registration Number (WRN), at another hand and as well as for other good tax terminologies and nomenclatures respectively!\\n', '\\n', '*6. Reform Number: 6 - the need to make separate and distinct Zakat and Waqf Collections, from Zakat and Waqf Distributions, in Nigeria!*\\n', '\\n', 'Equally also, because Zakat and Waqf Institutions are trust based institutions, separating Zakat and Waqf Collections, from Zakat and Waqf Distributions, can go along way, in reducing, if not eliminating the financial incentives to mismanage and misappropriate Zakat and Waqf Funds respectively, and while boosting the public confidence, in such Zakat and Waqf Institutions respectively! \\n', '\\n', 'It may interest some of us to know that, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for example, Invisible Zakat, is collected by the Ministry of Finance, through an agency called \"Zakat, Tax and Custom Authority (ZATCA)\", while the Zakat is distributed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, through an agency called \"Social Security Office\", while the Visible Zakat, is administered by a Special Committee consisting of both the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Home Affairs of the Kingdom respectively! \\n', '\\n', '*7. Reform Number: 7 - the need to understand the fact that, Zakat and Waqf, though are religious institutions, but nevertheless are more of economic institutions than religious institutions!*\\n', '\\n', 'The above understanding of Zakat and Waqf Institutions is strategically key, especially, in not only recruitment of personnel, in such institutions, but equally, in the political appointments of both the Members of the Zakat Management Committees (ZMC), at one hand and Zakat Governing Boards (ZGBs), at another hand and of such Zakat and Waqf Institutions respectively! \\n', '\\n', \"It may interest so many of us, to know that, with proper Shari'ah Supervisory Boards (SSBs) constituted and appointed, for a given Zakat and Waqf Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees, for example, an Economists would likely perform more better, as the Executive Secretary (ES) of either the Zakat and Waqf Management Committee (ZMC) or the Chairman of the Zakat and Waqf Governing Boards (ZGBs) of such Zakat and Waqf Commissions, Boards Authorities and Commitees, than an Islamic Scholar, with little or no knowledge of Economics, especially Economics of Zakat and Waqf respectively - indeed Zakat and Waqf are more of Economics than Islamic Studies and this is one strategic aspects and dimensions of Zakat and Waqf administration that many Politicians, in Nigeria are clueless about and that is why, they always politically failed to put a round peg, in the round hole, in the political appointments of Experts to manage and govern such institutions and no wonder the presence of such Zakat and Waqf Institutions are hardly felt, in Nigeria! \\n\", '\\n', '*8. Reform Number: 8 - the best roles and responsibilities of Governments, with regards to Zakat and Waqf administration, in Nigeria!*\\n', '\\n', 'As far as I am concerned, the best political role and responsibilities of Governments, especially State Governments of Nigeria and with regards to the administration of Zakat and Waqf in Nigeria are three (3):\\n', '\\n', 'a. Government to politically establish and enact a LEGAL FRAMEWORKS, for the administration of Zakat and Waqf, in the State and amend it, from time to time and with view to bring such laws, in tandem with the realities of Zakat and Waqf administration, in the State and global and national best practices - in line with the global conventional trends, this law can be politically consolidated, to be the Islamic Social Protection Law (ISPL) and with view to accommodate other instruments and tools of Islamic Social Finance (ISF) respectively;\\n', '\\n', 'b. Government to establish a REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS, for the administration of Zakat and Waqf, in the State - by regulatory frameworks, I mean a dedicated Governmental Agency, that would regulate the operations (and operators), management (and managers), as well as governance (and governing boards) of Zakat and Waqf Institutions, in the State, by setting standards, guidelines, manuals, code of conducts, dispute resolutions, sanctions, etc with regards to the administration of Zakat and Waqf, in the State - *of course there should be a dedicated Shariah Supervisory Boards (SSBs) to ensure the Shari\\'ah Governance and Reviews of all the regulations of this Zakat and Waqf Regulatory Agency* - again; in line with the global conventional trends, this Governmental Agency can be reffered to as \"Islamic Social Protection Regulatory Agency (ISPRA)\" and with view to accommodate other instruments and tools of Islamic Social Finance (ISF) respectively; and \\n', '\\n', 'c. Government to establish its own separate Department or Unit, for the actual Zakat and Waqf operations or initiatives of the Government and in line with the regulations enforced by the State Zakat and Waqf Regulatory Agency - again; in line with the global conventional trends, this Department can be called \"Islamic Social Protection Department (ISPD)\" and with view to accommodate other instruments and tools of Islamic Social Finance (ISF) respectively!\\n', '\\n', 'Any State Government that does that, had indeed solve most of the political challenges of the Islamic Social Finance (ISF), in the State!\\n', '\\n', '*9. Reform Number: 9 - on the urgent need for the institutionalization of \"Zakat on Salary\", at one hand and \"Cash Waqf\", at another hand, in Nigeria!*\\n', '\\n', 'Instituting both Zakat on the consolidated salaries and wages, that reaches Nisab (Zakat Benchmark) at one hand and Voluntary Cash Waqf (VCW), at another hand and enforcing it, among all the salaried and waged workers, in each State in Nigeria, can go along way, in not only eradicating poverty and vulnerability, in such State, but equally, in reducing the widening gaps between Haves and Have Nots, in such States of Nigeria! \\n', '\\n', 'Interestingly, Zakat on Salary and other Incomes, from Professions and Vocations are global best practices, in most of the Muslim majority countries, such as in Asia, Middle East and North Africa!\\n', '\\n', '*10. Reform Number: 10 - the need to transform the Zakat and Waqf Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees, to Simply Islamic Social Protection Commissions, Boards, Authorities and Commitees and in line with the global conventional trends!*\\n', '\\n', 'There is a global conventional trends, championed by such Multilateral Institutions, as the International Labour Organisation (ILO), World Bank, UNDP etc, towards the consolidations of all forms and dimensions of supports, interventions, assistances, etc, to both the poor and the vulnerables, into simply \"Social Protection\"! \\n', '\\n', 'In the above regards, harmonizing, integrating and consolidating other tools and instruments of Islamic Social Finance (ISF), apart from only Zakat and Waqf and including the following:\\n', '\\n', '# Islamic Alms Giving (Sadaqah);\\n', '\\n', '# Benevolent Loans (Qard Hassan);\\n', '\\n', '# Islamic Guardianship (Kafalah);\\n', '\\n', '# Islamic Social Feeding (nfaqah);\\n', '\\n', '# Islamic Social Guarantee (Dhumanah);\\n', '\\n', '# Islamic Social Enterprises;\\n', '\\n', '# Islamic Crowd Funding;\\n', '\\n', 'Etc\\n', '\\n', 'May give rise to \"Islamic Social Protection System (ISPS)\" and through these integrated systems, I personally doubt, if there is any social problems or challenges of the Muslim Ummah that cannot be tackled and surmounted respectively! \\n', '\\n', '*11. Reform Number: 1 - the need to integrate Islamic Commercial Finance (ICF) with Islamic Social Finance (ISF), in Nigeria!*\\n', '\\n', 'If there is one overarching challenge to the realisation of the potentials and promises of Islamic Social Finance (ISF) is the challenge of \"DONOR FATIGUE\" - only God can give you today, tomorrow and to eternity, but certainly not human, as such integrating ISF with ICF, in such a way and manner that, the former can access the latter, with view to access finance, and to finance its socioeconomic activities is key!\\n', '\\n', \"Put differently, Zakat and Waqf Institutions should no longer wait for philanthropic donations and alms, from well meaning individuals, to finance its socioeconomic activities; it's rather a high time, such Institutions learn to access Islamic Financial Markets (IFMs), at one hand and Islamic Financial Instruments (IFIs), at another hand and with view to access the necessary finances, to impact on people and the society positively! \\n\", '\\n', 'Zakat and Waqf Institutions can for example access both IFMs and IFIs to get the necessary finances, to establish Awqafs, for example, use the usufructs and other sources of funds to service the loans and when they finish paying, then use the usufructs for a given social causes!\\n', '\\n', '*12. Reform Number: 12 - the need to integrate the theories and practices of Zakat and Waqf administration, in Nigeria!*\\n', '\\n', 'The above means, there is need to introduce what is known as \"Triple Helix Model\" - consisting of the Zakat and Waqf Industry Operators, the Government and the Academia - in the administration of Zakat and Waqf, in Nigeria and with view to ensure basic and applied researches are carried out, financed and with view to solve the Zakat and Waqf administration challenges puzzles and problems, in Nigeria! \\n', '\\n', 'In this regards, a \"Professorial Chairs\" on Zakat and Waqf can be established, for the Zakat and Waqf Institutions, at one hand and a Two-Way Sabbaticals, for the Zakat and Waqf Managers and Academics, can equally be arranged and with view to share knowledge and experiences, at another hand!\\n', '\\n', 'Let me conclude by saying that, the above ten (12) Reform Proposals, if religiously and adequately introduced and instituted, can go along way, in the transformation of Zakat and Waqf administration in Nigeria and from a dirty jewels, to one that glitters, not only now and always, but equally to the benefits, rather demerits of all and sundry, in Nigeria!

The workshop targeted faculty members and postgraduate students, offering them insights into the responsible application of AI technologies in academic settings.\\n', '\\n', \"The workshop was organized with two primary objectives. First, it was part of Microsoft's AI skilling initiative in Kenya, which aims to position the country as a global hub for AI talent by training one million people in generative AI and cybersecurity. This effort aligns with Microsoft 's vision of empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more. Second, as a leading research center, MSR sought to gain firsthand insights into how faculty members and postgraduate students in Kenya are using generative AI tools. This learning experience will help uncover new use cases, benefits, concerns, and challenges specific to the African context, ultimately providing actionable insights and recommendations for developing equitable AI that serves everyone.\\n\", '\\n', \"The workshop was structured to focus on faculty members during the first two days, while the last day was dedicated to postgraduate students, including both PhD candidates and master's students. To foster collaboration and knowledge exchange, the workshop featured a variety of activities, including survey icebreakers using Mentimeter, breakout sessions, presentations, hands-on learning, panel discussions, and feedback sessions.\\n\", '\\n', 'To gauge the perception, applications, and adoption of generative AI tools among faculty members with over a year of experience, we asked for their opinions on integrating Bing Copilot or ChatGPT into exam settings, similar to how calculators are used. During one of the breakout sessions, participants were presented with academic writing and research policies from leading institutions like UNESCO, Springer Nature Group, STM Publishing News, Cornell University, Texas A&M University, Michigan Institute for Data and AI in Society and other academic research policy & guidelines from across the globe. Their task was to analyze these guidelines and identify what constitutes acceptable, unacceptable, and ambiguous uses of AI tools in academic endeavors. In one of the practical sessions, postgraduate students learned how to use Bing Copilot to support their research.\\n', '\\n', 'The presentations from the breakout sessions and the feedback revealed a strong enthusiasm for integrating generative AI into academic work. However, it was noted that current policies and regulations do not permit the use of generative AI in academic settings such as exams hall. Despite this, some faculty members suggested that these tools could be used for formative assessments, while others argued that, depending on the competencies being evaluated, AI tools could still be beneficial even if regulations do not explicitly allow their use. A concern was raised that without pushing for the adoption of these tools, students in Kenya might struggle to compete with their peers worldwide who are already utilizing AI in various contexts.\\n', '\\n', 'As an organization that embraces a growth mindset, we solicited feedback on what went well during the workshop and areas for improvement. One key piece of feedback was the regret that regulators were not present to understand and internalize the implications of these transformative AI tools on education.\\n', '\\n', \"Participants highlighted several standout moments from the workshop. Many acknowledged how tools like Bing Copilot can enhance knowledge transfer across domains, a point that emerged from a breakout session based on Ethan Mollick 's co-authored paper on three barriers to learning in the classroom. Additionally, participants were impressed by Teams for Education's personalized learning offerings video by Mike Tholfsen and expressed their belief in its potential to support their work. The deck shared by Winnie Karanu, which provided free Microsoft skilling resources, was also highly appreciated. One postgraduate student remarked, I won’t be caught using generative AI tools irresponsibly because today’s training has clarified what is acceptable and what requires caution.\\n\", '\\n', 'The workshop concluded on a positive note, with numerous calls to replicate the training and inquiries about whether Microsoft would assist universities in developing their own responsible use policies for generative AI.\\n', '\\n', '~ Najib A.A Gambo\\n', '[24/08/2024, 17:44:28] ~\\u202fSafiya Peace: 8.

Amin summa Amin! \\n', '\\n', 'While Congratulating His Royal Highness (HRH), permit me to humbly use this singular opportunity and media, to urge His Royal Highness (HRH), to use his good Royal Throne, at one hand and personal influences, at another hand, to royally see to the political and social transformation of the Family System, in Kano State, in particular and Northern Nigeria, in particular, through translating all the recommendations and significances of the Thesis to PUBLIC POLICIES, in Kano State, if not in Nigeria and with regards to the Islamic Family System respectively!\\n', '\\n', 'Though, I am yet to neither read nor peruse, any of the contents of the Thesis, but this notwithstanding and looking at the title of the Thesis, especially the comparative case study nature of the Thesis, at one hand and remembering the fact that, His Royal Highness (HRH), is an intellectual epitome of saturia elegance, in Islam and Islamic Law, at another hand, I am sure the Thesis, is full of practical answers, to the practical family questions many are continuously asking, in Kano State and in Northern Nigeria, at large, especially those dealing with irresponsible parents and parenting, at one hand and those on the ugly trends of divorces and divorcees, at another hand, in Kano State and Northern Nigeria, at large, and unfortunately to the extent that, a certain Islamic Scholar, in Kano State was once reported to have proclaimed that, *\"if marital divorces are actually announced, just like marriages are announced via Television and Radio Stations, in Kano State, for example, then, if the rates of marital divorces are not more than, the rates of marriages, then, they two would definitely be at par with each other\"* and this is indeed a family problem, which Islam have a lot of solutions to,  unfortunately, while our contemporary Islamic Scholars, with all due respect to them are politically clueless about, how to leverage on the contemporary politics, especially the tenents of democracy, to bring them forth politically, as competitive solutions, our contemporary Muslim Politicians, are also with all due respect to them, also Islamically clueless, about how to leverage, on the beautiful Islamic teachings and legacies, to bring about the socioeconomic sociopolitical and sociocultural transformations and development, we all politically, economically and socially aspire, individually and collectively!\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed, the kind of academic research, such as that of His Royal Highness (HRH), and targeted at benchmarking the Islamic legacies and teachings, in Family System, is undoubtedly the academic areas of study our contemporary societies, now aspires, to academically have - i.e the ones targeted at showcasing the potentials and promises of Islamic legacies and teachings, especially Islamic Law, in solving our contemporary socioeconomic, sociopolitical and sociocultural problems and challenges, in Nigeria - indeed, if moral decadence, poverty, unemployment, vulnerability, inequality, Homelessness, criminality, terrorism, banditry etc, are the sociopolitical, socioeconomic and sociocultural questions and challenges bedevilling us, individually and collectively, in Nigeria, then, surely Islam, in general and Islamic Law, in particular, has indeed a competitive answers, to whatever conventional man made laws answers and recommendations have to offer, with regards to the above mentioned problems and challenges and many more!\\n', '\\n', 'It may interest some of us to know that, in our contemporary political and social times, Islamic Law (Shariah), is gradually becoming a socioeconomic, sociopolitical and sociocultural force, to politically and socially reckon with, especially looking at the visible shortcomings of the man made laws, such as the following:\\n', '\\n', '1. I am sure many of us may be shocked to learn of the fact that, many developed countries, in the world, are legally transforming their contemporary Criminal Justice System (CJS), from the PUNITIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM (PCJS) to the RESTORATIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM (RCJS) respectively!\\n', '\\n', 'The idea of Restorative Criminal Justice System (RCJS), came as Criminologists, Penologists and Lawyers, noticed that Victims of a Crimes, are fortunately or unfortunately not made part of the criminal justice processes, under the Punitive Criminal Justice System (PCJS) and under PCJS, Crimes are rather only treated, as criminal offences against the State and unfortunately not  against the Victims of the Crimes, and even if such Victims are allowed in such criminal proceedings, they only play a minimal legal roles and hence frequently suffer mentally, emotionally and financially,\\n', 'due to the Crimes committed  against them and with no personal fault of theirs!\\n', '\\n', 'But, with Restorative Criminal Justice System (RCJS), rather than the State, being the main Stakeholder, in a situation of Crime, RCJS has made the Victims of a Crime, the Criminal Offenders, and the Society, at large, as the main Criminal Stakeholders, i.e. the parties directly affected, when a crime is committed. \\n', '\\n', '*Interestingly, recent empirical researches have proved that\\n', 'the concept of Restorative Criminal Justice System, is similar to that of Islamic Criminal Justice System (ICJS) especially, in the concepts of QISAS (Retaliatory) Criminal Offences and DIYYAH (COMPENSATION) respectively and where Criminal Victims and in ICJS, the Victim of Crimes are fully involved, in the legal prosecutions and from the beginning to the end!\\n', '\\n', '2. Again; in the contemporary Punitive Criminal Justice System (PCJS), there was also a concern about\\n', 'the effect of PRISONISATION, on the Criminal Offenders, as the rate of recidivism increased among the\\n', 'Criminal Offenders, who have completed the court sentences and unlike, in the Islamic Criminal Justice System, where the underlying objective of punitive measures focuses on the Criminal Offenders’ reform, through repentance!\\n', '\\n', 'The above therefore means, both the welfare and the wellbeing of the Criminal Offenders and the Victims of Crimes are adequately catered for in the Islamic Criminal Justice System (ICJS), with former being targeted for reformation and the latter being targeted for legal justice respectively!\\n', '\\n', '3. Another strong criticism against the Conventional Legal System (CLS), in general, especially the Common Law legal system, like that of Nigeria, is its ADVERSARIAL nature!\\n', '\\n', 'It may interest some of us to know the fact that, two (2) types of Legal Systems dominate the nature of legal investigation and adjudication, around the world: ADVERSARIAL and INQUISITORIAL Legal Systems respectively!\\n', '\\n', 'Generally, Common Law countries, such as Nigeria, use an ADVERSARIAL Legal system, to determine the legal facts and questions of law, in the adjudication processes and in these processes, the Prosecution and the Defence both compete against each other, in a legal debates and the Judge serves, as only a Legal Referee and with view to ensure justice and fairness, to the Accused, and that the legal rules and other procedures are strictly followed and adhered to respectively and no wonder such legal debates are known among lawyers as \"Civilized Warfare\"!\\n', '\\n', 'Additionally, the ADVERSARIAL Legal system assumes that, the best way to get, to the legal truth of any matter, is through a competitive processes, to determine the facts and applications of the law accurately, fortunately or unfortunately, this leads to a lot of wastages of economic resources, especially money and time, which as Professional Economists would say have an alternative uses and because, this system always lead to a legal winner taking all and the legal loser taking nothing, it always divides rather than unites the societies and beside leading to the unnecessary legal frivolities, fortunately hammering, on the legal forms, while unfortunately leaving the legal substances of the legal disputes or questions respectively!\\n', '\\n', 'The INQUISITORIAL Legal system, on the other hand, is legally associated, with Civil Law countries, especially the countries of the Continental Europe and it has existed for many centuries. \\n', '\\n', 'Additionally, the INQUISITORIAL Legal system, is characterized by extensive pre-trial investigations and interrogations of the Accused and with view to to avoid bringing an innocent person to trial and in the proces, a Legal Docket containing the details of such investigations and interrogations are normally prepared by the prosecution and presented to the Judge and the Judge adjudicate the legal disputes based on the contents of the Dockets and other legal considerations, by the Judge respectively!\\n', '\\n', 'Put differently, the INQUISITORIAL Legal System processes can be logically described, as an official legal inquiry to ascertain the legal truth, whereas the ADVERSARIAL Legal System system, uses a competitive legal processes, between the Prosecution and the Defence and with view to determine the legal facts of the case, as well as the question of the law and this INQUISITORIAL processes grants more legal power to the Judge, who oversees the process, whereas the Judge, in the ADVERSARIAL Legal system serves more as a Legal Arbiter, between the legal claims of the Prosecution and Defence respectively!\\n', '\\n', 'Fortunately, Islamic Legal System, can through the \"Ta\\'azir (Reformatory) Offences\" be said to be akin to INQUISITORIAL Legal System, in legal nature and hence an Islamic Judge, is normally granted a lot of legal powers, to decide a given case and with little or no wastage of resources, especially time and money, as well as the avoidance of the unnecessary legal frivolities, especially looking at the legal fact that, a justice delayed is indeed a justice denied and with this Inquisitorial nature of Islamic Law, it also mean, under Islamic Law jurisdictions, Legal Practitioners would definitely be confined to the Bench rather than in the Bar respectively!\\n', '\\n', '4. Another strong criticism against the Conventional Legal System (CLS), is the fact that, its based on the doctrines of \"Stare Decisis (Let the Decision Stand)\", which are principles that evolved from the earlier court holdings or decisions and no wonder the Blackstone, the old English Legal Authority once said *\"Courts were not delegated to pronounce new law, but simply to apply old principles\"*!\\n', '\\n', 'The principle of Stare Decisis means that adherence to a prior decisions of the Courts, especially Courts of superior jurisdictions has been regarded as necessary, to the operations of the legal system, in most countries, including Nigeria and this fortunately or unfortunately gave rise to the idea that, a a Legal Practitioners can, with leveraging of the principle of Stare Decisis, not only legally predict the outcomes of the law, in a given situation and when a client, is to be legally advised, but equally, can legally engage in \"Creative Legal Practices\" with view to achieve this favourable legal outcomes for his or her clients respectively!\\n', '\\n', 'Now adays, there is a growing legal feeling that, Judges should be allowed to engage, in a legal practice referred to as \"SOCIAL ENGINEERING\" by the Legal Professionals, which means Judges should be allowed to shape the law and to their own individual social, political and economic beliefs, though many legal observers feel that, engaging in this Social Engineering, by Judges is an outright usurpation of the privileges and responsibilities of the legislature, who are by the doctrine of the separation of powers charged with the roles and responsibilities to make a law!\\n', '\\n', 'Interestingly, Islamic Law through \"Ta\\'azir\" had allowed a considerable rooms for Judges to engage, in all forms of Social Engineering and as the facts of the case may legally dictate and this can go along way, in legally eliminating, if not reducing legal absurdities and other creative legal practices, associated with the leverage of the principle of the Stares Decisis!\\n', '\\n', '5. Malise Ruthven stated that, while LOVE is the “central theme” of Christianity, JUSTICE, is the central\\n', 'theme of Islam!\\n', '\\n', 'The justice as the central theme of Islam is manifested and continue to be manifested, in \"Islamic Economic System\" and its offspring \"the Islamic Financial System\" for example and in the form of such Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs), as Islamic Banks, Islamic Insurance (Takaful) Companies, Islamic Mutual Funds, Islamic Microfinance Banks, Islamic Cooperative Societies, Islamic Social Enterprises, Islamic Capital and Money Markets, Islamic Venture Capital, Islamic Private Equity, Islamic Pension Fund etc and all derived and based upon the dictates and principles of Islamic Law (Shari\\'ah)!\\n', '\\n', 'In conclusion, let me conceptually put Islamic Criminal Law (Shariah), in proper legal perspective, by submitting the fact that, what is called \"Islamic Criminal Law (ICL)\" is actually inclusive of three (3) types of Crimes and Punishments and as prescribed in Islam, namely:\\n', '\\n', '*# Hudud (Fixed) Offences* and they are seven (7) in numbers, namely:\\n', '\\n', '1. Al-Zinah (Adultery or Fornication);\\n', '2. Al-Qadhf (Slander or False Accusation);\\n', '3. Al-Sariqah (Theft);\\n', '4. Al-Shurbul Khamr (Drinking of Alcohol)\\n', '5. Al-Hirabah (Armed Robbery);\\n', '6. Al-Riddah (Apostasy);\\n', '7. Al-Baghye (Treason or Rebellion);\\n', '\\n', \"The punishment for all of the above are all prescribed by the Holy Qur'an and Sunnah (Prophetic Sayings and Deeds) respectively!\\n\", '\\n', 'Though many seem to look at Hudud Offences as a set of harsh and stringent punishments due to the\\n', '“popularised” cutting of the hands, for the crime of theft or whipping or lashing, for the crime of\\n', 'adultery, this notwithstanding the central principle, in the application of the Hudud punishments, is actually to maximise mercy, to the Criminal Offenders and since providing or establishing Hudud Crimes require strict and stringent adherence to the rules of evidence of Islam, and it has to reach a\\n', 'very high standard of evidences, for that matter, before one can be Islamically convicted and punished, for a Hudud Offences and a slightest doubt can drop Hudud charges and make convictions almost difficult, if not impossible - In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for example, and according to empirical studies, of the 4925 convictions, for theft, in a period of one year, only two cases, where the punishment of cutting of hand actually took\\n', 'place!\\n', '\\n', '*# Qisas (Retaliatory) Offences*, such as an eye for eye and a limb for limb etc; and\\n', '\\n', '*# Taa’zir (Reformatory) Offences*, such as lying, breaking promises etc\\n', '\\n', 'Currently, it\\n', \"Is Ta’zir Offences that is mostly being applied legally, in the contemporary Nigeria's Islamic or Shari'ah Courts and unlike Ta’zir Offences, both the\\n\", 'Hudud and the Qisas Offences are clearly mentioned, in the Holy Quran and Hadith (Prophetic Sayings) and both the Crimes\\n', 'and Punishments are fixed by these two (2) sources of Islamic Law respectively!\\n', '\\n', 'Furthermore; Ta’zir Offences, unlike the Hudud and Qisas Offences comprises Crimes and Punishments, that are not\\n', 'provided for, neither in the Quran nor in the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW), and the legal authority to legally decide, on what forms and dimensions these Crimes and Punishments, may take is left with the Judges and in the form of Social Engineering, as mentioned above! \\n', '\\n', 'The above and many more are pointers, to the potentials and promises of Islamic Law, as an effective alternative to the Conventional Man Made Laws and in the political, economic and social transformation of our contemporary societies, from a dirty jewels to one that glitters, not only now and always, but equally, to the social merits and rather social demerits of all and sundry! \\n', '\\n', 'God knows the best!\\n', '\\n', '*Once again, congratulations, His Royal Highness, Dr. Sanusi Lamiɗo Sanusi, the Emir of Kano State, the Centre of Commerce and for this long overdue academic achievement!* \\n', '\\n', '*©️ This pieces was written by Engr.

Kperogi\\n', '\\n', 'The directive by education minister Professor Tahir Mamman to the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) and the National Examinations Council to not register candidates who are below 18 for next year’s school certificate examinations is generating knee-jerk resistance from people who are obviously nescient of the psychology and philosophy behind age benchmarks in education.\\n', '\\n', 'In most countries of the world, children don’t start primary school until they are 6, and young adults don’t start university until they are 18. That used to be true in Nigeria, too—until parents chose to skirt the law, upend time-tested tradition, and commit mass child abuse in the name of fast-tracking the education their children.\\n', '\\n', 'In fact, contrary to what the Nigerian news media has been reporting, Professor Mamman has not created a new law; he is only implementing the existing law. He hasn’t “banned” under-18 students from taking school certificate exams; he has merely chosen to enforce an extant law, which has been serially violated by overeager parents who want their children to get ahead by any means.\\n', '\\n', 'The 1982 education policy, also called the 6:3:3:4 system, requires that children should be at least 5 years old to start pre-primary school and at least 6 years old to start primary school. If a 6-year-old spends 6 years in primary school, 3 years in junior secondary school, and another 3 years in secondary school, they would be 18 by the time they graduate from secondary school.\\n', '\\n', 'This is the global standard. In the United States, students apply to enter universities between the ages of 18 and 19 (because if you don’t turn 6 in September of the year you want to start First Grade, you have to wait until next year). In Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, Japan, South Africa, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, etc. it is 18.\\n', '\\n', 'The age benchmark isn’t arbitrary. It is based on time-honored insights from developmental psychology and educational research, which examined the cognitive, social, and emotional developments of children.\\n', '\\n', 'For example, Jean Piaget’s stages of cognitive development tell us that around age 6, children transition from what is called the preoperational stage to the concrete operational stage, at which point they begin to develop logical thinking, which is essential for learning the structured curriculum of primary school education, such as reading, writing, and mathematics.\\n', '\\n', 'Research also shows that children develop the social skills needed to interact with peers and teachers in a school environment and the attention span necessary to learn, absorb information, and stay engaged at 6, and that children who start school too early struggle with these skills, which can lead to long-term challenges in academic and social areas.\\n', '\\n', 'That was why the late Professor Aliu Babatunde Fafunwa was famous for saying any education of children before the age of 5 is a waste of time and even child abuse. From ages 1 through 5, children should be allowed to be children: sleep, play, laugh, and grow. \\n', '\\n', 'Of course, I recognize that because most mothers now work, enrolling children in schools earlier than is ideal is a necessity. But the busy schedule of parents is no excuse to buck science, ignore the requirements of a well-integrated childhood, and contribute to the mass production of maladjusted adults.\\n', '\\n', 'Similarly, research in developmental psychology shows that by age 18, most teenagers have reached a level of emotional and social maturity that enables them to live independently, make decisions, and handle the challenges of university life.\\n', '\\n', ' Neuroscientific research also shows that the brain continues to develop well into the early twenties, particularly the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making, impulse control, and planning. By age 18, the brain has typically matured enough to handle the complex cognitive demands of higher education.\\n', '\\n', 'Plus, in many countries, including in Nigeria, 18 is the age of legal adulthood, which aligns with the transition to university. This legal framework supports the idea that students are ready to take on the responsibilities associated with higher education, such as managing their own time, finances, and education.\\n', '\\n', 'Of course, as with everything, there are always exceptions. Precocious children can and do skip grades and start university earlier than 18 even in the United States and elsewhere. There are exceptionally gifted children who graduate from university as early as 11. But such students undergo rigorous tests to determine that they have intelligence that is far ahead of normal developmental schedules. They are also few and far between.\\n', '\\n', 'That’s not the situation in Nigeria. Just like our bad national habit of always wanting to jump the queue—what Americans call cut in line—Nigerian parents have, over the years, developed impatience for the normal development schedules of their children and want them to get ahead against the evidence of science, common sense, and even the law of the land.\\n', '\\n', ' It is not because their children are exceptional. In fact, they are often mediocre. For example, my brother’s son, who is only 14 years old and with average intelligence, registered to take his WAEC exam this year. I told my brother that was inexcusable child abuse.\\n', '\\n', ' Nigeria has a bad reputation across the world for sending underage children not just to domestic universities but also to foreign universities. People who work at the International Student and Scholar Services at the university where I am a professor have asked me multiple times why only Nigeria sends underage students here.\\n', '\\n', 'The consensus is that such students often lack maturity, have difficulty engaging in adult conversations, and struggle to fit in and get the best of the opportunities they have.\\n', '\\n', 'Several Nigerians who teach at other U.S. universities share the same stories. As I pointed out earlier, here in the United States, like in most other countries of the world, students don’t begin their undergraduate education until they are 18, which also happens to be the age of consent.

This day belongs to every Nigerian who has dared to dream of a better future. Congratulations to our great nation—today, we all stand a little taller.\\n', '\\n', 'Aliko, it feels like just yesterday, but it has been 25 long years since we first set our sights on transforming Nigeria’s energy landscape. I remember vividly when we set up the Blue Star Consortium to acquire stakes in the Kaduna and Port Harcourt refineries—20% for me and 51% for you. We were ready to change the game, but fate had other plans. The government of the day, in an act I can only describe as utterly obnoxious, canceled our stakes and thwarted our vision. But, as always, you refused to be deterred.\\n', '\\n', 'You never gave up on the dream we shared. You carried the torch forward, igniting a spark that has today become a roaring flame. And now, 25 years later, here we stand on the precipice of history, with the first fuel shipment from the Dangote Refinery—a feat that is nothing short of miraculous.\\n', '\\n', 'While the Kaduna and Port Harcourt refineries have remained dormant, their promise unfulfilled despite billions of dollars spent on so-called turn-around maintenance, you have achieved what many said was impossible. You have beaten all the skeptics, silenced the naysayers, and proved wrong those who doubted your resolve, even those who never wanted this project to succeed.\\n', '\\n', 'You have not just built a refinery; you have liberated us from the chains of economic dependence that have held this nation back for far too long. The days of bowing to foreign powers for our fuel needs are over, thanks to your vision and determination. You have dealt a death blow to the so-called local cabals who have fattened themselves for years, feeding off our nation’s economic slavery. These cabals, who have grown rich by keeping Nigeria in a perpetual state of dependence, must now face the reality that their era of easy gains is coming to an end.\\n', '\\n', 'I am reminded of the time you revolutionized the cement industry in Nigeria. Ships that once brought in cement turned into rusting relics, scraps of a bygone era. Now, with your refinery in full swing, I foresee a similar fate for fuel imports. The depot owners should take heed—it’s time to dismantle those depots and sell them as scraps while the market is still high. The world has changed, and those who do not adapt will be left behind.\\n', '\\n', 'When I ventured into the depot business with Zenon, it was in response to the inefficiencies of the NNPC. Zenon pioneered the diesel business in Nigeria and quickly became the largest in the country, filling the gaps left by our inefficient system.

Congratulations to you and the entire board, management and staff of Dangote Refinery on this monumental achievement. This is not just a victory for you but for every Nigerian who dares to dream.

Im saying a yearly orientation should be organized to the new set of SS1 students, that’s in the first term and for the SS3 students before they began writing any of their final year examination. The orientation for SS1 should focus mainly on what the students are into, what is expected from them and for them to have a great vision of their stay during the years, and the SS3 should be about how they should take the exams very serious, cautions them about everything that may happen.

You have to place \"TRUST\" on the Commercial Banks of Nigeria (including the Islamic Banks) on the fact that, they would be able to pay you back, anytime you want to withdraw your money and that these Commercial Banks would not go bankrupt!\\n', '\\n', \"Unfortunately, we have in the past witnessed in Nigeria, the runs on many Commercial Banks, as well as financial panics, which proved the fact that, one cannot still be certain that his or her money are safe inside these Banks and notwithstanding the insurance of the deposits and heavy regulations metted on these Commercial Banks; are they, Sirs and Ma'ams?\\n\", '\\n', '*Fortunately, with Blockchain Technology, no any Commercial Banks are really needed (including the Islamic Banks) - you rather manage your Cryptocurrency yourself and if as a Cryptocurrency user, you strictly take right precautions on your Cryptocurrencies, you can be sure your Cryptocurrencies are right where you left them!*\\n', '\\n', '2. You have to equally \"TRUST\" the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will not create too much fiat  money, which can lead or result into inflation - CBN statutorily controls the issuance of currencies and coins in Nigeria, and as a legal tender and which are unfortunately not backed by any physical and valuable commodities (neither Silver nor Gold), but only the legal promise of the CBN to redeem them on demand and hence referred to as \"Fiat Money\"!\\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately, that currently in Nigeria we are experiencing running, if not galloping inflation, is an undisputed macroeconomic evidence to the macroeconomic fact that, CBN is printing too much money than our economy needs; furthermore, who remembers the Trillion Naira Ways and Means Advances (WMA) saga of the immediate past CBN Governor of Nigeria, to the  immediate past political administration of Nigeria of former President Muhammad Buhari?\\n', '\\n', '*Fortunately, Cryptocurrency are neither created nor issued by any Central Bank or Central Authority anywhere in the world - they are rather created or mined by the networks of puzzle solvers, at a predictable and steady rate and hence the question of monetary inflation and or deflation does not even arise - this also means, the CBN like the Commercial Banks are also not needed in this our crypto era!*\\n', '\\n', '3. We have to equally \"TRUST\" the Payment Service Banks (PSBs) of Nigeria, such as Remita, PayPal, Visa, MasterCard etc would actually allow us to spend or accept money online, ensure there are no double spends and that they would not reverse our transactions and that they would equally allow us to spend our money as we like or wish!\\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately, that is not always the case; who remembers when the Wikileaks, that Political Advocacy Group in America, was soliciting for public donations, some Governments in conjunction with some PSBs such as PayPal and Visa refused to allow such public donations from their customers - a failure of trust!\\n', '\\n', '*Fortunately, Cryptocurrency using the Blockchain Technology is a peer to peer transactions, which means transactions occur directly from one user to another directly and with no middlemen, such as PSBs, Commercial Banks and even the almighty Central Banks!* \\n', '\\n', '4. We equally have to TRUST that, Governments of Nigeria cannot wake up one day to confiscate our money or restrict the type of things that we can buy with our money and for whatever political reasons!\\n', '\\n', \"Unfortunately, the events in Cyprus in 2013 show how dangerous Governments can be to our currency, where people's deposits were confiscated to pay for the country's debts!\\n\", '\\n', '*Fortunately, there is virtually nothing Governments can do to negatively impact on Cryptocurrency - they cannot confiscate any digital coins, like they cannot prevent users and owners of digital coins from spending their digital coins however they like, though Governments can target the Exchange Companies for such digital coins, such as Binance for example, albeit only at the point at which people buy or sell the digital coins for fiat currencies like Naira!*\\n', '\\n', '5. Finally, we have to TRUST that our identity would not be compromised by the financial institutions of Nigeria! \\n', '\\n', 'Unfortunately, under the current monetary system, one must be compulsorily identified digitally to be able to use or transact business with any of the Nigerian financial institutions and hence the risks of such compromises are always there!\\n', '\\n', '*Fortunately, with Cryptocurrency, one can be and remained anonymous, even though all transactions are publicly viewable on the Blockchain - the sender and receiver of the digital coins are only known by a string of numbers and letters and as such, if one is careful, he or she can hardly be identified in the Blockchain!*\\n', '\\n', 'The above rationale behind the Blockchain Technology categorically shows that, the Shari\\'ah (Islamic Law) issues may not really be the employment and deployment of the technology per se, but simply on whether the development and employment of *\"Trustless System of Money\"* to conduct financial transactions, are actually in line with Maqasidul Shari\\'ah Al-Islamiyyah and hence halal or haram or not and to me, this is where an Islamic Legal Verdict (Fatwa) are urgently needed!\\n', '\\n', \"@ our Distinguished Islamic Scholars, in general and Shari'ah Scholars, in particular; over to you now, for such Islamic Legal Analysis and Islamic Legal Verdict (Fatwa) by extension!\\n\", '\\n', '*Jaumiraawo (Allah) woni andudo is a Fulani way of saying God knows best!*\\n', '\\n', 'References:\\n', '\\n', 'Elinda Lara (2013), Bitcoin For Beginners - the Complete Beginners Guide to Buying, Selling and Investing in Bitcoins!\\n', '\\n', '*This pieces was researched and compiled by Engr.

First, entrusting robots with sensitive tasks like babysitting or caregiving is risky. AI systems, no matter how advanced, still lack human empathy, judgment, and the ability to handle complex emotional situations. This raises serious questions about safety and reliability, especially in the context of children or vulnerable individuals.\\n', '\\n', 'Additionally, Musk’s claim that the robot can be your friend oversimplifies human connection. Relying on robots for companionship could lead to emotional detachment and further societal isolation, weakening real human relationships rather than fostering them.\\n', '\\n', 'Job displacement is another major issue. While automation can improve efficiency, it threatens to replace entire industries, particularly in low-skill jobs like domestic work or retail, without clear solutions for retraining displaced workers.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, privacy concerns are substantial.

Back then, life was more structured and organised, with a clearer, more established path laid out for people. People stayed in one job for 30 years.\\n', '\\n', 'Many lived in estates provided by the organisations they worked for, where they created lifelong friends and deep relationships. Fewer individuals attended university then, and the middle class was neither as large nor as diverse as it is today. At that time, having a university degree was a significant achievement, largely because many people lacked the opportunity to pursue higher education.\\n', '\\n', 'As individuals from rural communities in developing economies began to see the benefits of university education, more parents began sending their children to university as well, with the hope that they too would secure well-paying jobs. However, this increase in university attendance has also led to fiercer competition for desirable positions, especially in countries where industry growth has not kept pace with the rising number of graduates. These young professionals, upon graduating, require employment, yet record numbers are leaving university each year with fewer jobs available to accommodate them.\\n', '\\n', 'Many recent graduates, however, are failing to see the writing on the wall. That a university degree, while still important for many, isn’t as special as it used to be anymore. Instead, they continue to live in the past, where a man from their hometown who studied Economics at university could quickly secure a job at Shell or NNPC soon after graduation, remain there for 30 years, and then retire with a big paycheque. They fail to recognise that the man they admired was often the only one in his family, or even the entire village, to attend university. Today, nearly every family sends their children to university, and almost everyone in the village is either a graduate, a current student, or aspiring to enrol.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, since that Economics graduate landed his job at Shell, the country has not “established” more companies like Shell or NNPC to absorb the influx of new graduates. In fact, there has been a net loss of large corporations in many areas, exacerbating the employment challenge for new graduates. The world is a completely different place today. The pipeline of school to job to retirement is becoming a thing of the past.\\n', '\\n', 'This is why, more than ever, it’s crucial to see your university degree and even your first job as merely a starting point, and not the pinnacle of success. \\n', '\\n', 'Earning a degree or landing your first graduate job is great but it’s just the beginning; what truly matters is your imagination, creativity and what you continue to do afterwards. To stay competitive in today’s global job market, you must maintain the curiosity of a child, keep an open mind to new and evolving opportunities, and commit to continuous learning, skill development, and personal growth. \\n', '\\n', 'The era of staying at one job for 30 years and specialising in one thing and getting promoted every 3 years, is long gone. You must be agile and treat your career with an entrepreneurial mindset, because in this ever changing world, that’s what we all are – entrepreneurs. You are the owner of a business, and the asset of that business is your skills.

Understanding Emotional Intelligence: Emotional intelligence involves the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others. Goleman identifies five key components: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.\\n', '\\n', '2. Self-Awareness: Self-awareness is the ability to understand your own emotions and their impact on your thoughts and behavior. Goleman emphasizes the importance of recognizing your emotional states and how they affect your actions and decisions.\\n', '\\n', '3. Self-Regulation: Self-regulation involves managing your emotions in healthy ways. Goleman highlights the importance of controlling impulsive feelings and behaviors, managing stress, and adapting to changing circumstances.\\n', '\\n', '4. Intrinsic Motivation: High levels of emotional intelligence are associated with strong intrinsic motivation. Goleman suggests that being driven by internal rewards, such as personal growth and fulfillment, rather than external rewards, leads to higher achievement and satisfaction.\\n', '\\n', '5. Empathy: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Goleman argues that empathy is crucial for building strong relationships, effective communication, and compassionate leadership.\\n', '\\n', '6. Social Skills: Social skills involve managing relationships to move people in desired directions. Goleman emphasizes the importance of effective communication, conflict resolution, and the ability to work well in teams.\\n', '\\n', '7. The Impact on Leadership: Emotional intelligence is a key trait of effective leaders. Goleman explains that leaders with high EQ can inspire, motivate, and connect with their teams more effectively than those who rely solely on intellectual capabilities.\\n', '\\n', '8. Emotional Intelligence in the Workplace: EQ is critical for workplace success. Goleman discusses how employees with high emotional intelligence can better navigate the social complexities of the workplace, lead and work well with others, and achieve higher job performance.\\n', '\\n', '9. Developing Emotional Intelligence: Unlike IQ, which is largely static, emotional intelligence can be developed and improved over time. Goleman provides strategies for enhancing each component of EQ through self-reflection, mindfulness, and practice.\\n', '\\n', '10. The Link Between Emotional Intelligence and Well-being: Goleman highlights the strong connection between emotional intelligence and overall well-being. People with high EQ tend to have better mental health, stronger relationships, and greater resilience to stress.\\n', '\\n', 'These lessons from \"Emotional Intelligence\" underscore the profound impact that understanding and managing emotions can have on all aspects of life, from personal relationships to professional success and overall well-being.\\n', '\\u200e[14/10/2024, 06:23:08] Abubakar Nasiru IDGA: \\u200eimage omitted\\n', '[14/10/2024, 07:07:59] Jamilu Yakubu IDGA: Thanks you so much\\n', '[14/10/2024, 08:06:02] ~\\u202fAbu_Husain: Mr. President: Affordable Fuel is Possible at Zero Subsidy\\n', '\\n', 'Yesterday evening, I listened attentively to a panel of experts and stakeholders on the BBC program Ra’ayi Riga, anchored by Umaima Sani Abdulmumin. The program ended with a big doubt in my mind regarding a matter purported to be a provision of OPEC and crucial to the price of petrol in Nigeria.\\n', '\\n', 'Tyranny\\n', '\\n', 'I could not fathom how particularly the representatives of NNPC and IPMAN stressed that Nigerians will be at the mercy of two variables: the international market and the price of the US Dollar in Nigeria. They said OPEC agreement compels member countries to sell allocated domestic crude at international rate even if refined locally. One of them even said the Iran-Israel conflict can cause domestic price of petrol in Nigeria to rise. 😳\\n', '\\n', 'So we should expect higher fuel prices anytime the rate of the dollar appreciates in Nigeria and also when, for any reason, there is a rise in the cost of crude in the international market. It is the rule, according to them. Our fate, they claim, is sealed, regardless of our OPEC membership and Dangote refinery. Nigerians will no longer have a stable fuel price.\\n', '\\n', 'Trust me, in Nigeria, the equation will be simultaneous. At any given moment, a reason will be found to use either or both parameters to increase pump price. The target of government is to extract more revenue from citizens while the businessmen in Dangote, Major Marketers, NNPCL and IPMAN continue to feed their greed for endless profit with our blood.\\n', '\\n', 'One would wonder why OPEC would be so oppressive in inflicting such tyranny on the citizens of its members. Senator Ndume, who was in the panel, said if he cannot understand why, how would they expect a commoner sitting under the tree to do so?\\n', '\\n', 'The truth\\n', '\\n', 'The truth is that there is no provision like that in OPEC agreements. In fact, the very idea of domestic crude quota arose in realization that citizens of member countries may need to enjoy cheaper oil than the international market price. That is why those citizens have been enjoying cheaper fuel for the past five decades in different countries. Many still do. Why not Nigerians?\\n', '\\n', 'If you ask ChatGPT whether OPEC agreement compels member countries to sell crude for domestic consumption at international market price only, this is the answer you get:\\n', '\\n', '“OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) does not directly compel member countries to sell crude oil for domestic consumption at international market prices. OPEC’s primary role is to coordinate and unify petroleum policies among member countries to stabilize oil markets and secure a steady supply of oil.\\n', '\\n', '“However, OPEC’s production quotas, agreements on output levels, and policies can indirectly influence domestic oil pricing. In practice, many OPEC members choose to sell crude oil domestically at subsidized rates or prices lower than the international market. This decision is made at the discretion of individual member countries, often as part of national energy policies aimed at supporting domestic economies and industries. Nonetheless, these policies may vary from one member country to another depending on domestic priorities and economic strategies.\\n', '\\n', '“There is no formal OPEC rule that requires domestic sales to match international prices, though it can be influenced by international agreements and market pressures.”\\n', '\\n', 'The Truth\\n', '\\n', 'The truth is that the President and Minister of Petroleum can sell our 445,000 barrels a day to Dangote at even N50,000/barrel after taking into consideration the cost of extraction and OPEC will not raise any eyebrow. Dangote can charge the cost of refining, add his profit and sell to NNPCL and IPMAN at, say, N300/litre. On their part the marketers will add their cost of transportation, storage, profit, etc., and sell it to Nigerians at N400/litre. And—boom—we all will be happy. \\n', '\\n', 'It is entirely the discretion of the President and his government. So whoever wants to sell our locally produced fuel by that simultaneous equation is on his own. There is no OPEC in the equation.\\n', '\\n', 'The Squeeze\\n', '\\n', 'Also, among those who would fight against Nigerians enjoying affordable fuel rates are the IMF, World Bank and the West generally. They want the government to squeeze us the more such that we can service our debts and collect more loans from the Shylock. The age long philosophy is: our poverty, their wealth; our pain, their joy.\\n', '\\n', 'Added to these are local liberal economists who believe in high taxation, claiming that the blood money will be used to develop our infrastructure, health, education, etc. It is just the same old bunkum selling since 1986 at the debut of Naira devaluation while our infrastructure, hospitals and schools continue to deteriorate in rebuttal of that thesis.\\n', '\\n', 'A Call\\n', '\\n', 'I call on the President to consider the low income status of our citizen. Only affordable fuel price will hold together our social fabric, ensure our prosperity and guarantee our security. It is zero subsidy because we are not buying it from anyone. It is our oil.\\n', '\\n', 'The President must keep in mind that the IMF and oil magnates are not his partners in 2027. He is on his own.

Back then, life was more structured and organised, with a clearer, more established path laid out for people. People stayed in one job for 30 years.\\n', '\\n', 'Many lived in estates provided by the organisations they worked for, where they created lifelong friends and deep relationships. Fewer individuals attended university then, and the middle class was neither as large nor as diverse as it is today. At that time, having a university degree was a significant achievement, largely because many people lacked the opportunity to pursue higher education.\\n', '\\n', 'As individuals from rural communities in developing economies began to see the benefits of university education, more parents began sending their children to university as well, with the hope that they too would secure well-paying jobs. However, this increase in university attendance has also led to fiercer competition for desirable positions, especially in countries where industry growth has not kept pace with the rising number of graduates. These young professionals, upon graduating, require employment, yet record numbers are leaving university each year with fewer jobs available to accommodate them.\\n', '\\n', 'Many recent graduates, however, are failing to see the writing on the wall. That a university degree, while still important for many, isn’t as special as it used to be anymore. Instead, they continue to live in the past, where a man from their hometown who studied Economics at university could quickly secure a job at Shell or NNPC soon after graduation, remain there for 30 years, and then retire with a big paycheque. They fail to recognise that the man they admired was often the only one in his family, or even the entire village, to attend university. Today, nearly every family sends their children to university, and almost everyone in the village is either a graduate, a current student, or aspiring to enrol.\\n', '\\n', 'Moreover, since that Economics graduate landed his job at Shell, the country has not “established” more companies like Shell or NNPC to absorb the influx of new graduates. In fact, there has been a net loss of large corporations in many areas, exacerbating the employment challenge for new graduates. The world is a completely different place today. The pipeline of school to job to retirement is becoming a thing of the past.\\n', '\\n', 'This is why, more than ever, it’s crucial to see your university degree and even your first job as merely a starting point, and not the pinnacle of success. \\n', '\\n', 'Earning a degree or landing your first graduate job is great but it’s just the beginning; what truly matters is your imagination, creativity and what you continue to do afterwards. To stay competitive in today’s global job market, you must maintain the curiosity of a child, keep an open mind to new and evolving opportunities, and commit to continuous learning, skill development, and personal growth. \\n', '\\n', 'The era of staying at one job for 30 years and specialising in one thing and getting promoted every 3 years, is long gone. You must be agile and treat your career with an entrepreneurial mindset, because in this ever changing world, that’s what we all are – entrepreneurs. You are the owner of a business, and the asset of that business is your skills. How you cultivate and leverage that asset will likely determine and shape your career path.\\n', '\\n', \"May the student in you never die!'\\n\", '\\n', '©️Suleiman Ahmed\\n', '[15/10/2024, 10:41:48] Engr.

With rising costs of transportation, many civil servants are now unable to afford commuting to work five days a week, forcing them to attend office only two or three days. This unintended consequence is disrupting productivity and straining public services, but more critically, it highlights the growing financial struggles of workers in the state.\\n', '\\n', 'For the average civil servant, the journey to and from work is a significant expense. With fuel prices skyrocketing, the cost of transportation has doubled, if not tripled, leaving many workers with the impossible choice of either spending a large portion of their income on transportation or cutting down on their workdays. This scenario has led to reduced working hours, affecting not just the workers but the state’s overall output in terms of governance and public services.\\n', '\\n', 'The plight of civil servants in Katsina State is a reflection of the harsh realities faced by many across the nation. The higher cost of living, compounded by the fuel hike, is eroding the purchasing power of families. Civil servants, who are among the most dedicated workers ensuring that the machinery of government runs smoothly, are now faced with overwhelming financial pressure. Many struggle to make ends meet, with their wages no longer able to support the rising cost of basic necessities like food, rent, and transportation.\\n', '\\n', 'To address this crisis, there is an urgent need for intervention from Governor Dikko Umaru Radda. The introduction of the ₦70,000 minimum wage could be a much-needed lifeline for civil servants. This adjustment would go a long way in cushioning the effects of the fuel price hike and alleviating the financial burden on workers. In addition, the state government could explore providing buses along key routes to assist civil servants in commuting to work. This would not only reduce transportation costs but also ensure that workers can attend their duties consistently, without the fear of exhausting their monthly income on fuel.\\n', '\\n', 'Alternatively, a reduction in the working week, from five days to three, while the civil servants can work virtually for the remaining 2 days so as to ease the strain. This measure, if well-organized, could help civil servants manage their transportation costs without drastically impacting the services they provide. Some states have successfully adopted such measures during periods of economic hardship, and Katsina could follow suit as a temporary solution.\\n', '\\n', 'The current economic challenges, while severe, are not insurmountable. However, the government must act swiftly to prevent the erosion of the civil service, a critical backbone of the state. By implementing the proposed minimum wage, providing subsidized transport, or reducing workdays, Governor Radda can demonstrate his commitment to the welfare of civil servants and the masses at large. These workers deserve support as they navigate these trying times, and decisive action will go a long way in alleviating their burdens.\\n', '\\n', 'In conclusion, it is evidently clear that the fuel price hike has made it difficult for many civil servants in Katsina State to attend work regularly. As such we appeal to Governor Radda to implement the ₦70,000 minimum wage, provide transportation solutions, or consider reducing workdays. The well-being of civil servants is crucial to the state’s progress, and these measures will ensure that they continue to serve the people of Katsina effectively.\\n', '\\n', 'Fatima Sanda Kaita\\n', 'fskaita@gmail.com\\n', '[15/10/2024, 19:49:43] Faisal Kurfi: https://www.ubagroup.com/national-essay-competition/\\n', '[15/10/2024, 20:18:55] ~\\u202fAJ: https://ngojobsite.com/logistics-assistant-at-international-rescue-committee-irc-2/\\n', '[15/10/2024, 20:21:07] ~\\u202fJaz Multi-concept Limited: 🌟 *Call for Applications: Directory of Women-Led Businesses in Nigeria* 🌟\\n', '\\n', 'The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) is developing  a Directory of Women-Led Businesses in Nigeria!\\n', '\\n', 'We invite  women-led businesses that are registered with NEPC to submit the following details for inclusion in the Directory:\\n', '\\n', 'i.

In other words, 15% goes to the FG and 85% stays within the state. This 15% FG share forms part of the FAAC allocation that’s shared to the states (based on population and 13% for oil producing states). \\n', 'Now, Tinubu is proposing 10% to the FG and 90% stays within the state (that produced the IGR). \\n', 'This means that states that generate high IGR gets richer because there’s more money going the state (from 85% to 90%) and less going to the FG (from 15% down to 10%). Hence, less FAAC allocation (“National cake”) that get shared to the states at the end of the month. \\n', 'Why are 19 the Northern states collectively objecting the bill? \\n', 'Well… it’s anyone’s guess. The IGR of all the 19 Northern states combined is less than half of Lagos IGR. To give you the numerical card, Lagos has an IGR of N815.86 billion while the combined IGR of the 19 northern states is N487 billion (2023 Data). Rivers state has an IGR of N203.86 billion, Ogun has an IGR of N150 billion, etc. This is the reason why Lagos has 8 power substations (330 kV) while the entire 19 norther states have only 3 of such (330 kV). \\n', 'In other words, the 19 northern states are “parasites” 🦠 feeding on their “host” (the South). So, any attempt to disrupt this unbalanced and unfair arrangement would be fiercely fought by the “parasite” (the North). \\n', 'Tinubu must go ahead with this reform. You can’t be generating money and not use it for your people but get sent to Kano or Borno against your will. \\n', 'This is the primary reason the North doesn’t want this unholy union (Nigeria) to dissolve because they are getting free money without doing anything. \\n', 'If Tinubu doesn’t push this bill through, I will when I become president.\\n', '-Aliyu Muhammad Bello\\n', '[01/11/2024, 11:24:03] Fatima Adam: https://youtube.com/@ipledge2nigeriatv-u5y?si=tE8QroW8RT1DidCP\\n', '[01/11/2024, 11:45:08] ~\\u202fMydigital Tutorz: If this bill successfully comes into effect, I believe that peace will return to the North.

This match wasn’t just a sporting event—it was a masterclass in discipline, preparation, and the importance of knowing when to fight and when to step back. Tyson, at 58, entered the ring against a much younger Jake Paul, whose strategy, preparation, and discipline outmatched the legend’s legacy.\\n', '\\n', 'This fight also offers a powerful reminder of key lessons from Robert Greene’s “The 48 Laws of Power”—not just about discipline, but also about the dangers of failing to assess your opponents and the wisdom in knowing when to stop fighting.\\n', '\\n', '1. Discipline Over Emotion\\n', '\\n', 'Tyson’s wisdom about mental strength is timeless: emotions can lead to impulsive decisions, but discipline creates success. Jake Paul demonstrated this by entering the ring fully prepared, with a calculated strategy that capitalized on his youth and training. Tyson, though a legend, seemed to rely on his reputation and past dominance rather than his readiness for the present battle. The 48 Laws of Power reminds us, “The rational is stronger than the emotional; control the emotional and you win.”\\n', '\\n', 'Paul’s composed approach to the fight echoes Law 33: Discover Each Man’s Thumbscrew. He recognized Tyson’s weaknesses—age and endurance—and exploited them with precision, landing 78 punches to Tyson’s mere 18. Discipline and preparation trumped emotion and nostalgia.\\n', '\\n', '2. Know When to Stop Fighting\\n', '\\n', 'Tyson’s career is marked by unmatched success, but this fight highlights the critical importance of knowing when to step back. Greene’s Law 47: Do Not Go Past the Mark You Aimed For warns against overreaching. Tyson’s legacy is cemented, yet by stepping into this fight at 58, he risked undermining it. “In victory, learn when to stop,” Greene advises. Continuing to fight battles you’re no longer equipped to win can diminish your past achievements.\\n', '\\n', 'Knowing when to stop isn’t a sign of weakness—it’s a hallmark of wisdom. Tyson could have preserved his legendary status by focusing on mentoring or commentary rather than stepping back into the ring. Men must recognize when their time to fight has passed and shift their focus to other avenues of success.\\n', '\\n', '3. Size Your Opponent\\n', '\\n', 'Tyson’s loss also underscores Law 48: Assume Formlessness—the need to adapt and assess the battlefield. Jake Paul, though less experienced, was young, agile, and hungry for a win. Tyson, on the other hand, entered the ring with the aura of his past but without the physical and mental sharpness needed to match Paul’s preparation.\\n', '\\n', 'Greene’s Law 19: Know Who You’re Dealing With applies here. Tyson may have underestimated Paul’s resolve and preparation. Overconfidence can lead to defeat, especially when you fail to analyze your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses. Men, take note: never enter a battle without fully understanding who stands on the other side.\\n', '\\n', '4. The Danger of Legacy Over Preparation\\n', '\\n', 'Relying on past achievements is dangerous. Tyson’s loss highlights the gap between past glory and present reality. Greene’s Law 1: Never Outshine the Master teaches us to honor the lessons of those before us, but Tyson’s choice to reenter the ring against a younger, more adaptable opponent demonstrated the peril of leaning too heavily on past victories.\\n', '\\n', 'Men, learn from this: legacy cannot replace preparation. No matter your past successes, every new challenge requires fresh discipline and readiness.\\n', '\\n', '5. Wisdom in Knowing When to Fight\\n', '\\n', 'Not every battle is worth fighting. Tyson’s fight against Paul was a stark reminder of Law 23: Concentrate Your Forces. Spreading yourself thin, physically or mentally, can lead to unnecessary losses. In life, just as in the ring, choose your battles wisely. Assess your strengths, your opponent, and the potential outcomes. Sometimes, the smartest move is to walk away.\\n', '\\n', 'Key Lessons from the Fight\\n', '\\n', '• Discipline Beats Emotion: Preparation, strategy, and focus will always outweigh raw emotion.

It is an Arabic word, and the original term in Arabic is Mualim, which means a learned person or teacher. \\n', '\\n', 'The word in Arabic is not pronounced slowly. Arabs pronounce it very fast, and if you are not a native Arab speaker, you will hear Malim, pronounced like the name Malik. \\n', '\\n', 'Now, Hausa is actually not a Cushitic language, like Lukumi Yoruba, Igbo and Ijaw, to mention a few. It is a Semitic Afro-Asiatic language with a broader vocabulary than a language like Lukumi Yoruba.\\n', '\\n', \"Unknown to many Nigerians, Hausa resembles the Ge'ez-based Semitic languages of Amharic and Tigrinya. \\n\", '\\n', 'And even the way Hausas describe themselves is a dead giveaway that they originated from a similar line as modern day Ethiopians. \\n', '\\n', 'Ethiopians do not call themselves Ethiopians or their country Ethiopia. The name Ethiopia is a relatively recent name for their country. It is less than a hundred years old. In Ethiopia, they refer to their country as Habesha, which Europeans heard and Romanticised as Abyssinia. \\n', '\\n', \"In the Jewish holy book, Ethiopia is known as Sheba (2 Chronicles 9:1), and the modern-day nation of Yemen is known as Saba (Sabeans from Saba were the ones who attacked and killed Job's family in Job 1:15-22). \\n\", '\\n', 'In al-Quran, the modern-day nation of Ethiopia is known as al-Habasha.\\n', '\\n', 'Now, how do Hausa people refer to themselves as a group? Bahaushiya! And individually, it is Bahaushe. Notice the similarity? \\n', '\\n', 'Culturally, people of Hausa heritage have much in common with modern-day Ethiopians. For example, Southern Nigerian ethnic groups do not ululate during celebrations. But Hausa do. They ululate and dress almost identically to Amharic and Tigray people, the dominant ethnic groups in modern Ethiopia. \\n', '\\n', 'I am married to an Ethiopian. On my wedding day, my family members who attended my wedding ceremony asked me why I was dressed like Hausa. My wife used henna on her hands like Hausa brides did when I was a child and still do today. \\n', '\\n', 'I have attached two photos to this post. One is of a Hausa girl during her wedding. The other is of a Habesha bride at her nuptials. Please can you identify who is Hausa and which one is Habesha? \\n', '\\n', 'If you can actually look at Hausa culture before Islam and especially before the Usman Dan Fodio Jihad of 1804, there are more similarities between the two cultures.\\n', '\\n', 'But after the Jihad, Hausa almost ceased being an ethnicity and became a language, and many pure Hausas were divorced from their origins, and a lot of their history was lost. \\n', '\\n', 'If not, ask yourself how Hausa can be an Afro-Asiatic language when it is surrounded by Niger-Congo languages, such as Fulfulde (big surprise. Fulfulde is NOT an Afro-Asiatic or Semitic language. Fact-check me), Nupe, Lukumi Yoruba, and Tiv? \\n', '\\n', 'Now, let me shock you.

Like any human being, he had his shortcomings, but leadership should be judged not solely by its flaws but by its strengths and the legacies left behind. True wisdom lies in focusing on and building upon these strengths, rather than fixating on weaknesses. When we honor the legacies of impactful leaders, we foster an environment of respect and regard, a culture that encourages future leaders to prioritize national development over personal gain.\\n', '\\n', 'The debate over whether a military or democratic government can drive true development is, in my opinion, irrelevant. The key determinant of progress is not the system of governance but the quality of leadership within it. Leadership rises and falls on the vision, character, and competence of the individual. A great leader must possess the wisdom to reflect on the past for insights to address today’s challenges and the foresight to create systems that prepare for the future.\\n', '\\n', 'By this measure, IBB has done remarkably well. His leadership demonstrated a commitment to establishing structures and systems that addressed the needs of his time while anticipating future challenges. Such forward-thinking initiatives deserve recognition and celebration.

We have thousands of graduates roaming the streets with neither their desired jobs nor the required skills to earn an income. \\u200e<This message was edited>\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:01:50] UMAR ASK: There is videography, photography, and content writing that are more relevant and career-aligned to journalism that Above-mentioned skills, from my point of view, learning skills relevant to a career aspirations is more important than just learning any skill you see; passion-driven work is more sustainable.\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:09:10] Umar Mustapha Kutawa: Totally got your point and very valid , let me give you example , at sometime my dad took me to become tailor , which is in no relation with what I am doing right now but i assure that experience shaped my mindset and prepare me for who I’m becoming. \\n', '\\n', 'The point here is , yes one need to learn relevant skills to what they intended to become but one need a practical survival skills in Nigeria. \\n', '\\n', 'If this IT didn’t work for me with all the relevant skills I can simply open a tailor shop and I believe you’ll be of my client 😀.\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:09:43] ~\\u202fBugajeAsiyakabir: They are not going to be force to do,they will choose on their own and those skills you are seeing will help them to find their nitche , open their brain and make them to understand how today works and the future , skills rather than just a degree,by that early stage the brain will be able to navigate ah choose what it best for it  later in life , because they already cultivate interest in their mindset and sense of responsibility rather than the stupid curriculum we go through that was always preparing our mindset to get the white collar job which is no more available and many are stranded no job no skills...haba Mal Umar stop discouraging irin wadanan abubuwa go to China Japan and see they are not downgrading any skills for the young and they will grow up doing amazing Things mother ur thinking..\\n', 'Me as a person who went through teachers training I know the power of training children mindset to be productive...\\n', 'That plumbing da kake Raina zai iya tasiri the child will be doing beyond that even modernize it an get a company for it and employ people under him... this is what we call Development Mal Umar .\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:11:51] ~\\u202fBugajeAsiyakabir: The journalist are too many and is not something we need everyday in our lives..they are now many without jobs make a survey an get what am saying.\\n', '\\u200e[19/11/2024, 08:12:51] Umar Mustapha Kutawa: \\u200eimage omitted\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:14:28] El Sunais: Both @2348068697297 and @2348032329932 opinions are right.\\n', '\\n', 'Thank you @2348065050262 and @2348135409256.\\n', '\\n', 'The best part of this group *for me*, is this kind of conversation.\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:15:06] UMAR ASK: Good Morning \\n', '\\n', 'Please get my point. 😂, I am not discouraging any skills, but as I mentioned, the skill options are too small and they will not solve our unemployment problem!!!!! \\n', '\\n', 'We need more options!!!! \\n', '\\n', 'They will reduce creativity and make our children limit their thinking on jobs that can solve our problems as a country!!!\\n', \"[19/11/2024, 08:18:48] ~\\u202fBugajeAsiyakabir: Wannan Shi ya wahalartar damu Mal.umar...this is the reason why you always see machanicak engineer taking his car to the mechanical in the street 😂🤣u can't do anything all he knows is theory because of downgrading the skills,and also electrical engineering calling one local man which they refers to Mai gyaran wuta a gidanshi abun kunya😂🤣u with the paper and him with the practical had it being we get it right today it will be so many companies that will be doing such an providing better jobs for those talented people..untill we try to get it right the country will develop ,if not where are we going pls?\\n\", '[19/11/2024, 08:19:39] ~\\u202fBugajeAsiyakabir: Thank you sir🙏🏽\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:20:08] ~\\u202fBibi: \\u200eUmar Mustapha Kutawa added ~\\u202fBibi\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:20:46] UMAR ASK: Nigeria, Katsina, and every part of the world need people that are problem solvers, not just service rendering individuals. \\n', '\\n', 'We need innovation and creativity from every part of our lives; the health sector, economy, IT, etc.\\xa0\\n', '\\n', 'But anyway, we all have different views on things like this\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:22:56] ~\\u202fBugajeAsiyakabir: Then Mal Umar we need you to reform this and pass to those people responsible and give them your reason, for the development of the country..beside I will like to know from you which skills you think are much better pls?\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:23:01] UMAR ASK: Thank you Boss @2347050700903\\n', '[19/11/2024, 08:24:52] Yusuf Hamisu: Exactly. \\n', '\\n', 'Steve Jobs studied liberal arts at college for one year before he dropped out.

Multi-concept Limited: Guiding principles\\n', 'The work of the committee will be guided by the following principles:\\n', 'National Interest – every member and participants regardless of their affiliation or political interests shall put Nigeria’s interest first and above all other considerations. International best practice ideas should be considered within our local context.\\n', 'Data driven – Proposals must be evidence based and all submissions and recommendation must be data driven to the extent possible. In God we trust, all others must bring data (Edwards Deming).\\n', 'Impact assessment – Every proposal shall be accompanied with detailed impact assessment both quantitative and qualitative as it may affect stakeholders directly and indirectly in terms of the ultimate burden or benefit where applicable.\\n', 'Tax philosophy – Let everyone breathe especially the poor. Government does not intend to tax poverty but rather promote prosperity and share out of it by way of tax. Taxes on investment or production will be eliminated to the extent practicable in favour of taxes on returns, income and consumption. We will only tax fruits, not seeds.\\n', 'No new taxes – We do not intend to introduce new taxes or increase the rates of existing taxes except if it becomes necessary to compensate for harmonised taxes and levies or prevent revenue loss.\\n', 'Facilitate inclusive growth – We will remove tax and fiscal bottlenecks and disincentives. Our goal is to promote investment and facilitate economic growth as a sustainable way to grow and diversify government revenue.\\n', 'Ensure equity – We will promote fiscal equity for all stakeholders including investors and businesses, both local and foreign, and all tiers of government – federal and subnational\\n', 'Diversity of views – We will seek and respect members and other stakeholders’ views. We will consult widely with all key stakeholders and the general public. Differences and disagreements should be expressed professionally with civility. It is not who is right, but what is right, that is of importance – Thomas Huxley.\\n', 'Partnership and co-creation – We will partner with key stakeholders including organised private sector, public institutions, the media, civil society, international organisations and the Nigerian people.\\n', 'Prioritise – We will prioritise our interventions and recommendations focusing on the most impactful and relatively easy to implement measures in terms of time, cost and complexity starting with issues on which there is broad consensus.\\n', '[30/11/2024, 13:04:13] ~\\u202fJaz Multi-concept Limited: What Exactly Is The Presidential Fiscal Policy & Tax Reforms Committee Set Up To Do?\\n', 'The committee was set up by President Bola Tinubu to review and redesign Nigeria’s fiscal system with respect to (1) revenue mobilisation, both tax and non-tax (2) quality of government spending and (3) sustainable debt management. In addition, the committee will identify relevant measures to make Nigeria an attractive destination for investment and facilitate inclusive economic growth.\\n', '\\n', 'What Is The Timeframe For The Committee’s Assignment?\\n', 'The work of the committee is expected to be completed within one year divided into 3 milestones (1) Quick Wins within 30 days focusing on urgent interventions to cushion the effect of current socio-economic challenges (2) Critical Reforms within 6 months including measures to address multiplicity of taxes, simplify the tax laws, ensure policy coordination, drive accountability and transparent reporting (3) Implementation of structural revenue reform measures and critical fiscal policy changes.\\n', '\\n', 'Is The Committee’s Mandate Limited To Only The Federal Government?\\n', 'No. The committee will work with all levels of government as critical stakeholders to ensure effective collaboration in the design and implementation of necessary fiscal policy changes and localisation of reforms at the subnational level as may be applicable.\\n', '\\n', 'Who Are The Members Of The Committee And What Was The Basis For Their Selection?\\n', 'embers of the committee are drawn from a diverse pool of eminently qualified Nigerians across all geopolitical zones, age brackets, religion, and gender. They represent the private sector including trade associations, small businesses, civil society, and professional bodies as well as public sector institutions at federal, states and local government levels.\\n', '\\n', 'How Can The Public Contribute To The Work Of The Committee?\\n', 'The committee will open channels of communication and platforms for submission of inputs by the end of September 2023. In addition, we have outlined various stakeholder engagement sessions with Nigerians from all walks of life including people living with disabilities, artisans, Nigerians in the diaspora, multinational companies, international investment community and so on. Everyone who has something to say will be heard.\\n', '\\n', 'Should We Expect More Taxes And Frequent Changes To The Tax Laws?\\n', 'We do not intend to introduce new taxes or impose higher tax rates. Rather, our mandate is to reduce the number of taxes and levies while harmonising revenue collection to reduce the burden on the people and businesses. The objective is to avoid taxing investment, capital, production or poverty. We plan to review and re-enact the major tax laws in a holistic manner thereby limiting the necessity for frequent changes through annual finance acts.\\n', '\\n', 'How Does The Committee Intend To Achieve A Tax To GDP Ratio Of 18% Within The Next 3 Years?\\n', 'The average tax to GDP ratio for Africa excluding Nigeria is about 18%. This is the basis for the target of 18% and the estimated tax gap of N20 trillion. There is a huge opportunity to generate revenue by leveraging technology and tax intelligence to close the tax gap. In addition, we will rationalize incentives, reduce the cost of collection, and optimise revenue from government assets and natural resources. This way we can generate more revenue without introducing new taxes.\\n', '\\n', 'Is It True That Agencies With Revenue Collection Functions Will Be Stopped From Collecting Revenues And Merged With The FIRS?\\n', 'No agency has been stopped from collecting revenue as many of them are empowered to do so by law. However, many of the agencies would rather focus on their primary functions hence we intend to harmonise the fragmented revenue collection functions into one agency for each government. This is the case in many countries including the leading tax regimes in Africa. This reform will help to improve efficiency and enable the agencies to focus on their primary mandates for the overall benefit of the economy.\\n', '\\n', 'Can We Trust The Government To Implement The Committee’s Recommendations Or Is This Just Another Committee?\\n', 'The committee was set up not just to advise the government but also to support the implementation of recommended reform measures. The committee’s assignment is being carried out to the highest degree of independence driven by national interest within the context of modern-day economic realities and emerging issues within the international community.\\n', '\\n', 'How Can We Stay Informed With The Activities Of The Committee?\\n', 'Members of the public and other stakeholders can follow our activities on social media, fiscalreformsng on X, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook and via our YouTube channel.

However, its implementation raises significant concerns about the economic implications for Northern Nigeria while amplifying advantages for states like Lagos. Below is a detailed breakdown of its impacts, supported by figures and insights.\\n', '\\n', 'Key Provisions and Their Implications\\n', '\\n', '1. Section 77: VAT Redistribution Formula\\n', '\\n', ' • Proposed Change: Transition to a consumption-based VAT distribution model emphasizing derivation (the location of consumption) over equality or population.\\n', ' • Impact on Lagos:\\n', 'Lagos currently generates over 50% of Nigeria’s VAT due to its status as an economic hub, housing multinational companies, high retail activities, and luxury consumption. For example:\\n', ' • In 2022, Lagos accounted for over ₦535 billion of VAT, compared to Kano’s ₦40 billion, despite Kano’s larger population ￼ ￼.\\n', ' • Under the new formula, Lagos stands to retain a larger share of the VAT, funneling more resources to infrastructure and business incentives.\\n', ' • Impact on Northern States:\\n', 'Northern states, relying heavily on equitable VAT redistribution, risk losing up to 30–40% of current allocations. This will severely affect states like Sokoto, Gombe, and Zamfara, which have limited economic activities and depend heavily on federal allocations.\\n', '\\n', '2. Centralized Tax Administration\\n', '\\n', ' • Current Model: States collect various taxes (e.g., environmental taxes, agricultural levies), allowing for localized revenue generation.\\n', ' • Proposed Reform: Centralizes tax collection under federal agencies like the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).\\n', ' • Impact:\\n', ' • States with diverse local taxes, such as Kano and Kaduna, could lose fiscal autonomy and revenues amounting to billions annually.\\n', ' • The North’s agrarian economy could be disproportionately affected, as agricultural value chains are underdeveloped compared to the commercial services prevalent in Lagos.\\n', '\\n', '3. Sectoral Impacts\\n', '\\n', ' • The North’s economic reliance on agriculture and informal trade contrasts sharply with Lagos’s diversified economy (finance, logistics, manufacturing). For instance:\\n', ' • Kano’s informal trade generates significant economic activity but contributes minimally to VAT, making the derivation formula inherently biased.\\n', ' • Lagos’s corporate taxes, tied to formalized sectors, would amplify its gains under the proposed framework.\\n', '\\n', 'Detailed Figures and Analysis\\n', '\\n', 'National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Data Insights\\n', '\\n', ' • VAT Contribution Breakdown (2022):\\n', ' • Lagos: 55% of total collections.\\n', ' • Northern States Combined: Less than 25%, with the majority contributed by Kano and Kaduna ￼.\\n', ' • Revenue Loss Estimate for Northern Nigeria:\\n', ' • VAT redistribution could shrink allocations to Northern states by ₦150–₦200 billion annually, particularly affecting education, healthcare, and infrastructure projects.\\n', '\\n', 'Economic Growth Disparities\\n', '\\n', ' • GDP Growth:\\n', ' • Lagos State’s GDP: ₦33.7 trillion (2022)—more than the combined GDP of the 19 Northern states.\\n', ' • Kano’s GDP: ₦2.3 trillion, largely reliant on trade and informal markets ￼.\\n', ' • Population Density vs. Economic Activity:\\n', ' • Northern Nigeria hosts over 60% of the national population yet accounts for less than 30% of economic activity, highlighting structural inequalities exacerbated by the proposed reforms.\\n', '\\n', 'Case Studies\\n', '\\n', 'Lagos’s Benefits\\n', '\\n', ' • Infrastructure: Additional VAT revenues could finance new projects like the ongoing Lekki Deep Sea Port and other mega-infrastructure developments.\\n', ' • Business Ecosystem: Favorable tax policies will likely attract more corporate headquarters, reinforcing Lagos’s dominance.\\n', '\\n', 'Northern Nigeria’s Challenges\\n', '\\n', ' • Agriculture Sector: Reduced funding for irrigation projects in Kano and Sokoto could jeopardize food security and rural livelihoods.\\n', ' • Social Programs: States like Borno and Yobe, grappling with insurgency recovery, may lack sufficient funds for reconstruction without equitable federal allocations.\\n', '\\n', 'Call to Action\\n', '\\n', 'Recommendations for Northern Stakeholders\\n', '\\n', ' 1. Legislative Advocacy:\\n', ' • Northern legislators must push for revisions to the VAT formula, ensuring population and equity remain core components.\\n', ' • Engage in bipartisan coalitions to demand fiscal federalism that balances derivation with national development goals.\\n', ' 2. Governors’ Forum:\\n', ' • State governors should unify to lobby for compensation mechanisms that offset potential revenue losses.\\n', ' • Explore Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to reduce reliance on federal allocations.\\n', ' 3. Economic Diversification:\\n', ' • Invest in agro-processing zones and renewable energy initiatives to boost regional GDP.\\n', ' • Leverage the North’s population advantage for labor-intensive industries like textile manufacturing.\\n', '\\n', 'Public Awareness\\n', '\\n', ' • Mobilize grassroots support through education campaigns highlighting the economic risks posed by the reforms.\\n', ' • Engage traditional and religious leaders to amplify advocacy efforts.\\n', '\\n', 'Conclusion\\n', '\\n', 'Section 77 of the tax reform bill represents a structural shift that could deepen economic inequalities between Northern and Southern Nigeria.

Within provisions of the proposed bills is a clause introducing taxes on inheritance wealth in a way that conflicts with religious teachings. Nigeria is a multi religious country whose laws should accommodate and support religious injunctions and not repeal them.\\n', '\\n', '2. As a Muslim, I know that Islamic law (Sharia) unequivocally governs the distribution of inheritance through clearly prescribed shares. Islam decreed a maximum of 25 inheritors of deceased persons and ratios of their inheritance, and government is not on the list. Therefore taxing inheritance wealth effectively alters this formula, diminishes the value passed to heirs and contradicts Islamic injunction. \\n', '\\n', '3. But the tax bills submitted by President Tinubu have added government on the list of inheritors. Within the provisions of the four bills sent by the president to the National Assembly, there are some provisions that make government an inheritor. For example, Chapter 2, Part 1, Section 4 (sub-section 3) of the National Tax Bill provides as follows:\\n', '“Income of a family recognized under any law or custom in Nigeria as family income in which the several interests of individual members of the family cannot be separately determined is chargeable to tax”. This is in direct conflict with Islamic law of inheritance. \\n', '\\n', '4. Under Sharia, if a father leaves an estate of ₦10 million, for instance, a legislated inheritance tax reducing the sum would inadvertently disrupt the ordained shares for his divinely prescribed inheritors. This alteration is not just financial but religious, raising concerns about overstepping divine jurisdiction.\\n', '\\n', '5. As a multi-religious state, Islam and Christianity dominate the cultural and legal landscape of Nigeria 🇳🇬. The constitution guarantees freedom of religion and safeguards practices integral to faith. Mandating inheritance taxation under the proposed bills is a direct infringement on Muslims’ right to practice their religion fully. Such legislation alienates a significant portion of the population, potentially stoking religious tensions in an already polarized society.\\n', '\\n', '6. Proponents of inheritance tax may argue that it promotes economic equity and curbing wealth concentration. While this is practiced in secular economies, it is critical to recognize that Nigeria is not a secular but a multi religious society. Legislators must therefore strike a balance between fiscal reforms and religious principles, ensuring inclusivity without undermining constitutional rights.\\n', '\\n', '7. Consequently, I call upon the National Assembly to amend the tax bills submitted to exempt inheritance wealth from taxation, as the matter has already been divinely preordained. This amendment would not only uphold religious freedom but also foster national unity by respecting the cultural and spiritual diversity that defines Nigeria. This is not to say that income from inheritance cannot be taxed; it can, but after distribution to lawful heirs as per the acceptable Islamic sharing formula. But as individual beneficiaries injects their share allocations into the process of trade, business, profession or vocation for income, profit or capital gains then the proceeds become taxable.\\n', '\\xa0\\n', '8. In seeking to broaden its tax base, government must explore alternative revenue sources that do not conflict with religious doctrines. Wealth taxes, capital gains taxes and luxury levies offer viable options without encroaching on sacred grounds. I advise the president to engage religious leaders and scholars in policy formulation on this issue in order to achieve reforms that are economically sound and socially harmonious.\\n', '\\n', '9. In conclusion, it needs pointing out that central to legislators’ roles is to bridge the gap between governance and the people’s values. The expunging of the inheritance tax provisions from the tax bills is not just a religious necessity but a political one as well. Proponents and supporters of the Muslim/Muslim ticket need to raise their voices on this religious infringement. Only through such sensitivity can Nigeria build an inclusive, equitable and spiritually aligned society.\\n', '[02/12/2024, 20:04:21] Aliyu Lumumba Jr Suleiman: *All Africa Students Union (AASU) General Assembly commence Tomorrow In Abuja*\\n', \"*We've Convene to re-examine Africa's Educational Curriculum.*\\n\", '\\n', \"*I'll be Presenting a peper on History of students Unionism in Africa.*✊🏾\\n\", '\\u200e[02/12/2024, 20:11:09] Aliyu Lumumba Jr Suleiman: \\u200eimage omitted\\n', '[02/12/2024, 20:42:55] Engr.

State and Local Governments of Nigeria, especially in the North had to make a lot of political efforts, to politically FORMALIZE their Local Economies, which are largely Informal Economies, through among other things ensuring both the *\"Digital Identification\"* and *\"Financial Inclusion\"* of their people and with view to fiscally EARN or DERIVE more VAT share;\\n', '\\n', \"2.

Kabir Ruma: *Duk wanda ke son ya fahimci what Tax and Fiscal Reforms of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu are all about, let him read the following:* 👇👇👇👇\\n', '[02/12/2024, 21:03:35] Engr. Kabir Ruma: By Raji Bello:\\n', '\\n', 'I may be a tax illiterate but I was able to pick a few things from all the discourse that is going on.\\n', '\\n', '1. The new VAT law has not come to introduce the much-feared system of crediting all VAT proceeds generated by an organisation to only the state that hosts its headquarters. It has actually come to abrogate it. This system is what obtains at present but will no longer be the case when the new law comes into effect.\\n', '\\n', '2. Under the new law, VAT distribution will be tied to actual consumption in each state. Every state gets an amount proportional to what is generated inside it.\\n', '\\n', '3. BUT the percentage of the VAT fund that will be shared based on derivation (actual local consumption) has been increased from 20% to 60%\\n', '\\n', '4. Simply put, when, for example, Lagos used to be given both its own money AND other peoples money (because it is hosting company headquarters), the amount shared based on derivation was 20% of the total but now that it will be given ONLY its own money (actually generated in Lagos), 60% of the national fund will be devoted to derivation.\\n', '\\n', '5. So strictly speaking, based on how I understand it, the new law has eliminated unfairness. Every state would get more VAT when it generates more. This is a good incentive for competition among the states. Let every state attract investments, grow its middle class and the purchasing power of its people, and its share will keep getting bigger.\\n', '\\n', '6. Yes, Lagos has advantages like federally-built sea ports that will give it more VAT revenue but it also has more responsibilities that would require spending money which other states are not burdened with.\\n', '\\n', \"7. If any state is complaining about the new law, it's not because its own money will be unfairly taken to another state, rather, it's because it will get less of the money that is generated in other states. So, any complain about the new law may just be based on the old sense of entitlement.\\n\", '\\n', '8. The 60% for derivation is not final and is still negotiable. There will be National Assembly public hearings where those who want to see it changed can articulate their positions. We should resist our usual temptation to push for the total disruption of processes instead of engaging and modifying them.\\n', '\\n', \"9. It doesn't make sense for any state to cry out that it would not be able to pay salaries under the new VAT law. This is because there is no limit to how much money a state can generate as revenue. If its VAT allocation reduces under the new law, a state can always generate other revenue to make up. In any case, there will be a new equalisation fund to assist such states. The impression that only centrally-obtained money can be used in the states is a myth that state governors have nurtured and propagated over the years to free themselves from the responsibility of generating more revenue internally. Governors may even be afraid of becoming reliant on internally-generated revenue because it could make their people to demand for more accountability.\\n\", '\\n', \"10. If every state is forced to sit up and generate revenue, which the new law will encourage, spending is likely to become more responsible. The money that a state generates through its own sweat is less likely to be spent on big black jeeps, chartered flights, new government houses, pilgrimage subsidy or unviable 'cargo airports.'\\n\", '\\n', '11. One of the people closely involved with the tax reform process said that if the current reform fails, states like Lagos and Rivers may resort to the legal route. Rivers has already tested this and gotten a judgement at the high court level which ruled that it is states that should collect VAT, not the FGN. That way, those states may get to keep 100% of their collection.\\n', '\\n', '12. While I concede that precedents for ethnically skewed appointments have been established before this government came, President Tinubu is responsible for some of the mass suspicion and hysteria against the current tax reform because he appointed people from just one part of the country to take charge of almost all economic and financial agencies of government, including the tax reform task force itself.\\n', '[02/12/2024, 21:09:54] Ibrahim Shafiu: Ni wlhy tunda aka fara magnr wnn TAX din nan duk sai na fahimci ba wani turanci nikeji ba, saboda ban gane komai Allah🥹💔\\n', '\\u200e[02/12/2024, 21:10:20] Engr.

Local collection:            N5.035 trn (55.07%)\\n', '2. International Services: N2.167 trn (23.70%)\\n', '3. Imports VAT:                   N1.941 trn (21.23%)\\n', '\\n', 'Secondly, Mr Oyedele asserted that the amount collected from International Services and Imports  VAT is not attributed to any State, it goes to the pool and is shared.\\n', 'But, the fact is that net collection from Nigeria Custom Service (NCS) and Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and after deduction to North East Development Commission (NEDC), is pooled together and shared vertically in proportion 50%, 35% and 15% to the States, the Federal Government and the Local Governments respectively. The 50% allocated to States is shared horizontally using a formular 50%, 30% and 20% based on equality, population and derivation respectively. Thus the collection from International Services and Imports are shared according to the same formular. Impliedly, Lagos State has been receiving the largest share of International Services and Imports VAT in the name of derivation. What a Scam!\\n', '\\n', 'Thirdly, he argued that the law guarantees that no State will collect any thing less than what it would have collected under the old formular.\\n', 'This is indeed, the trickiest part of it all. Ofcourse, no State will receive less but, for two possible reasons not because of the proposed sharing formular. The two reasons are:\\n', 'i. Increase in the VAT rate from 7.5% to 10%; this is likely to increase the total collection from arround N550bn monthly to between N700bn to N900bn. This will mean that States will receive at least what they have been receiving under the current arrangement. .\\n', 'II. The 5% fiscal equalization is an addition from the share of Federal Government. It is meant to serve as a buffer.\\n', 'While these two reasons can guarantee the fact that States will not receive less under the proposed formular, it also mean that Lagos State can receive  more than three folds of what it used to received under the extant law.\\n', '\\n', 'Fourthly, Mr Oydele also stated that the proposed reform intends to move away from where VAT is remited to where economic activities (actual consumption) is taking place. If this can be done with fairness, than it is ok.\\n', \"It is important to understand the meaning and how Value Added Tax (VAT) is being collected. VAT is a consumption tax that is levied on the value added at each stage of a product's production and distribution. This means, if a product worth N1bn it will attracts VAT of N100m at 10%. If the same product is transported from Lagos to, say, Kano for instance, at a cost of, say, N10m. That N10m is value added to the product and will attract VAT of 10%,; that is, N1m. The total cost of the product is now N1.111bn.\\n\", 'As such, the question that remains unanwered is, what portion of the VAT will be attributed to the consuming States?\\n', 'The total VAT paid; that is, N101m or the VAT on distribution alone which is just N1m?\\n', 'It appears he meant the second option; N100m will be recorded for Lagos and N1m will be recorded for Kano. Consequently, Lagos share will be roughly 99% of the total amount and Kano roughly 1%.\\n', 'Finally, it is becoming apparent that Lagos State is being soaked in to debt trap, with a total debt stock of more than N2.9trn. As such, debt service is eating up roughly 22% of its VAT share and about 26% of its total FAAC allocation. Hence, the need to improve on revenue generation. This, I think, motivate the entire reform.\\n', '\\n', 'However, in my opinion, the gradual increment in VAT from the current rate of 7.5% to 15% by 2030, given the prevailing economic condition,  is what Nigerians should be fighting.\\n', '\\n', 'Abdulrazaq Ibrahim, Ph.D.\\n', 'Department of Economics\\n', 'Northwest University Kano \\n', '(formerly Yusuf Maitama Sule University)\\n', '\\u200e[04/12/2024, 18:58:46] Faisal Kurfi: \\u200eimage omitted\\n', '\\u200e[05/12/2024, 14:02:28] ~\\u202fAJ: \\u200eimage omitted\\n', '[05/12/2024, 19:43:35] ~\\u202fFahd: \\u200eAbdulrazak YB added ~\\u202fFahd\\n', \"[05/12/2024, 20:41:02] ~\\u202fBello Dahiru: In The First 20 Hours , Josh Kaufman offers a systematic approach to rapid skill how to learn any new skill as quickly as possible.

A tide would sweep you away while time won't wait for you to be ready. It's on these premises I will proceed to discuss the five phenomena that, for quite a while, I strongly believe, have been strangulating the economic development of the Nigeria's Muslim North; invariably, until a deliberate, soul-searching, controlled and honest conversation on these phenomena is being organized and debated, the region will continue to lead in posting poor human development indices. \\n\", '\\n', '1. Population Explosion and Birth Control\\n', '\\n', \"Population, in itself, is not the problem. The problem is when you have an idle, unskilled population fiercely competing for scarce resources. For example, take a father with a monthly income of N100,000 having two children and a wife to cater for. That father, all things being equal, can afford a house rent of, say, N150,000 per annum, moderately feed his family, enroll his kids in a modest primary school, and most importantly, can afford to spare some time to attend to the social and psychological needs of his kids. Not that this is entirely okay, but certainly it's far better than what is mostly obtained in the region. \\n\", '\\n', 'Now, imagine another father with equal income but having two wives and ten children. There is no way he can provide for his family like the first father, no matter how much he tries because the resources are not enough, and they can never be. The result is that there is a greater likelihood of the children of the first father growing and becoming responsible adults, thus a high chance of making decent income and better life choices, given the strong correlation between acquiring quality education and economic success. In the case of the second father, the same cannot be optimistically inferred. \\n', '\\n', \"But a person can argue that it's the responsibility of the government to provide free and quality education. Doubtless. However, the government's irresponsibility isn't a tenable excuse for one to be irresponsible. One will still have to carry one's cross.\\n\", \"The truth of the matter is that Nigeria's Muslim North must arrest its unbridled race of producing 'needless' number of children; this in addition to stepping up to the challenge of being responsible to the ones already around. Traditional, religious, and political stakeholders must brace up for the challenge of forcing the bitter pill of birth control down the throats of the population. No economic growth can be achieved with an uneducated, unskilled, and idle population. \\n\", '\\n', '2. Bank Interest and Economic Growth\\n', '\\n', \"Economic growth and development are tied to the acquisition of capital. There are basically two ways to acquire a capital: inheritance and bank loans. Very few members of the population have rich parents whom they can rely upon for seed capital, so that rules out the 'inheritance factor' for most of the population. The ready option is to access loans from banks. But banks charge interest, and interest on bank loan, according to the mainstream interpretation of the Muslim North, is haram (prohibited). This is the dilemma the Muslim North has found itself deep in for years, and has failed to provide a third option. \\n\", '\\n', 'Bank interest is a reality we have to deal with. The consequence of not doing so may translate into a poverty-ravaged society which will, most certainly, birth all the imaginable societal dysfunctions: banditry, terrorism, violence, maternal mortality, child malnutrition, diseases, VVF, etc. Our best bet is to reinterpret the position of interest on bank loans. If no doctrinal reconciliation can be made, alternatively, the likes of Taj Bank and Jaiz Bank should engage in massive expansion and aggressive promotion. At the moment, they are doing very poorly. \\n', '\\n', '3. The Challenge of Socialist Orientation and Excessive Fatalism\\n', '\\n', 'The historical connection of the Muslim North to slavery had, subconsciously, produced a huge amount of population that believes free lunch is a birthright on one hand. On another hand, a skewed understanding of Islam produces a population with uncommon romance with excessive fatalism all in the name of belief in predestination (qadr). To be fair to the early Islamic scholars of the region, the fatalistic orientation was not entirely theirs; people have this tendency of always attributing their failures and carelessness to the softest and easiest doctrine they can relate to. \\n', '\\n', 'Notwithstanding, the triple effects of the remnants of slavery, socialist orientation, and influence of the [distorted] belief in predestination have, in no small measure, helped in creating people with a chronic sense of entitlement and fatalistic tendencies. A person would get his wife pregnant and be expecting his brother working in Abuja to foot the bills of the naming ceremony and whatnot. Nephews would be insulting and cursing uncles for their failures to give them (free) money. Younger and, sometimes, older siblings would be cursing and slandering a successful brother for not doing enough in giving them money to discharge their personal responsibilities. Students would not read very well or study courses that demand serious effort and longer duration, only to graduate with the wrong belief that \"it isn\\'t about what you study, but it\\'s \\'albarkan karatu\\' (\\'the blessing in what you have studied\\')\". \\n', '\\n', 'This cannot continue. Everyone must carry his own cross. People must learn to take personal responsibilities and appreciate the relationship between cause and effect, effort and reward. Prayer is not a substitute for hard work, and it never will be. [Caveat: this is not to discourage supporting those who genuinely deserve to be supported.]\\n', '\\n', '4. Women Participation in the Economy \\n', '\\n', \"There is just no way Nigeria's Muslim North can make meaningful strides in modernity, economic growth and development when half of its population is caged and denied reasonable participation in the region's economic activities. The culture that sees women as mere appendages of men, whose raison d'être is to attend to the dictates of men is archaic, nihilistic and incompatible with reality. Not only that we must take the responsibility of educating our womenfolk very seriously, but we must also ensure that, after being educated, they also participate in the economic activities of their choices, and be adequately rewarded for their contributions. We cannot continue with the obsolete, retrogressive culture of locking our womenfolk at homes. One half of the population cannot salvage the whole alone, and that we know from firsthand and secondhand experiences. By the way, why should a woman's success be a threat to a man? \\n\", '\\n', '5. Investment in Education  \\n', '\\n', 'After all said and done, nothing — I repeat, nothing— can be achieved without a deliberate, massive, and continuous investment in education by individuals and governments. At the moment, we are doing very poorly in that regard. Modern economy is built on the tripod of good governance, quality education, and relevant skills. The last two can only be acquired through standard schooling on which, at the moment, we have very little to brandish. Northern Nigeria as a region of over 100 million people has only two business schools, ten medical schools (of which two were recently established), five veterinary schools, one agriculture-based university, three technology-based universities. This is not normal. No region can compete while recording this abysmal performance in knowledge production. \\n', '\\n', \"No doubt, the world is a spectrum for endless possibilities. But possibilities remain what they are: possibilities. Without the knowledge and skill sets to harness and maximize the opportunities that abound in the region and beyond, nothing would happen. That's why the North, and by extension Nigeria, is littered with the presence of Indians, Chinese, Lebanese making a killing from the economy while native Nigerians are neck-deep in poverty, penury, and perpetual anger. \\n\", '\\n', \"The five phenomena highlighted above are, by no means, exhaustive. The Muslim North of Nigeria has two fight-or-flight options from which cue can be taken. One, the North must begin to hold critical, soul-searching, and honest conversations on the inevitable transition to modernity so that the changes anticipated can be controlled and determined, where cultural peculiarities and religious sensibilities can be taken into account. Two, the transition and changes will inevitably and assuredly happen, but at a pace the region cannot control, and with consequences better imagined. The Muslim North must choose its battle. And to choose not is also a choice. At the end, the choice and the cross are North's to make and carry respectively.\\n\", '\\n', '-Adamu Tilde\\n', \"[16/12/2024, 09:02:43] Sir Smart😎: I don't agree with your opinion, just recall people like Sardauna, Tafawa  Balewa, Yar'adua and their likes in sha allah sooner not later Nigeria will change. \\n\", '\\n', 'We still have numerous people that Nigeria 🇳🇬 is the priority of their lives and in sha allah we will take over.📌\\n', \"[16/12/2024, 09:04:34] Sir Smart😎: I believe we contribute alot but now we're ready to change the narration\\n\", '[16/12/2024, 09:39:34] ~\\u202fSaleem: You still haven’t provided any nuance or reasonable explanation for why we are the way we are.

For anyone with dreams and aspirations, alongside the drive to grow, I encourage you to avoid environments where you are the biggest—in ambition, intellect, or social class. Staying in spaces where your ideas are the most innovative, your knowledge the deepest, or your material status the highest can be limiting. It’s like being a big fish in a small pond—it feels comfortable, but it stifles growth.\\n\", '\\n', 'Instead, seek out environments that challenge and inspire you. Be in circles where you’re not the smartest person in the room, where others push you to think bigger and aim higher. Surround yourself with people and spaces where the average aligns with where you currently are or where you aspire to be. These environments will expand your perspective, fuel your ambition, and encourage you to stretch beyond your current limits.\\n', '\\n', 'Yes, this choice might attract labels. You may be called a capitalist, an overachiever, or other names. But you’re better off with these labels than constantly shrinking yourself or explaining your choices to those who don’t understand your vision.\\n', '\\n', 'When you feel you’re catching up with your environment—when it no longer challenges or excites you—move. The right environment will push you beyond your limits, but over time, even the best spaces can breed complacency. That’s why it’s essential to regularly reevaluate your surroundings alongside your goals. A truly empowering environment propels you to places significantly higher than where you started.\\n', '\\n', 'Remember, your environment isn’t just physical. It includes the social constructs around you—your family, friends, colleagues, and even the online communities you engage with. These relationships and networks can either amplify your growth or weigh you down.\\n', '\\n', 'As the year comes to an end, take time to reassess your environment(s). Move away from places, people, or habits that no longer serve your growth or align with your mission. But as you do so, aim to create mutual value.

All other reforms therein are inconsequential, which include the exemptions, inclusions, rate increment/reduction etc. Unfortunately, many of the proponents of this reform (of which some are northerners) based their opinions on some of these inconsequential arguments.\\n', '\\n', 'The born of contention (section 77 of the proposed bills) ⎼ the sharing formula. What appears to many of us from the initial stage of this reform is that the derivation parameter (point of generation), which presently attracts 20%, will be reformed to attract 60%. Meaning, the states that housed the headquarters of companies that produced the commodities on which VAT is charged will get more share than those with relatively few or none. Consequently, the reform will be injurious to northern states economically, since the locations of most of the headquarters of these companies are in the south, specifically Lagos, Rivers and Oyo states. Thereafter, in what appears to be like a U-turn, the FIRS boss suddenly announced that the sharing formula will be reformed, and consumption will now be the parameter for the sharing of VAT revenue among states, and it is expected that it (point of consumption) will attract 60%. Perhaps Tinubu’s administration knew fully that this will please the northern governors and appease them to support the reform, because northern leaders and some of its pressure groups have for long agitating for consumption-based model gullibly. Trojan-horse in the making!\\n', '\\n', 'It seems the promoters of the proposed VAT reform have done their home-work very well before presenting it as Trojan-horse for the North. From my rough analysis, which I’m very much sure the promoters of VAT reform are aware of, applying the proposed consumption-based model at 60% will yield similar results as point of generation model (the status quo) will do at 60%. Because both will see southern Nigeria as a whole collecting higher share from the total VAT revenue, leaving the north with a paltry share thereof. At this juncture, it’s very imperative for northern leaders to know that the economic implication of section 77 of these bills will be very severe for the north if implemented as it is. Some analysts forecasted that endorsing section 77 of the bills will put the north in a worst off position it has ever found itself since the nation’s independence!\\n', '\\n', 'Of the 50% VAT share in favor of states, 50% of it is shared on the basis of equality, 30% on the basis of population, while 20% on the basis of derivation (in favor of the states that housed the headquarters of the companies that produced the commodities on which VAT is charged). In essence, the proposed reform is intended to increase the derivative share from 20% to 60% using consumption based model, invariably reducing the percentages of equality and population bases (the “zero-sum” effect), which are the two parameters that “presumably” favors the North.\\n', '\\n', 'As established by the proponents of this reform, that VAT is a consumption tax, paid by the final consumers. Inferably, the more one consumes the more VAT one pays and consequently, the more one ought to receive from the federation account in respect of VAT revenue. Unfortunately, applying this yardstick (consumption level) will drag the northern states back by far behind the southern states, because the level of consumption in the South is by far higher than that of the North irrespective of the South’s smaller population size. This is what the North’s poverty level is portraying—under consumption of national resources (goods and services). Put simply, the higher the level of poverty the lower will be the level of consumption; consequently the lower will be the revenue from VAT. While on the other hand, the lower the level of poverty the higher will be the level of consumption; consequently, the higher will be the revenue from VAT. Hence, population growth without consumption (purchasing) power is useless and disadvantageous to the Northern states, if used as benchmark for determination of VAT revenue allocation! Therefore, insistence for the review of the existing sharing formula of VAT revenue by the Tinubu’s administration (as supported by some gullible northerners) on the basis of consumption will most likely predispose the North to a worst off position.\\n', '\\n', 'The principle of catch-22 upon which the Nigerian economy is based will not allow the practical application of consumption-based model to be of any benefit for Northern Nigeria. “Catch-22 is a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule” (Mariam Webster Dictionary). Example: “To get a job, you need work experience. But to get that work experience, you need to have had a job”. This is exactly the position of Northern Nigeria in relation to the proposed Tax reform (section 77). Thus:\\n', '\\n', '“Northern Nigerian states cannot go out of their socio-economic problems until they have access to basic infrastructure, productive assets, decent education etc.; but the Northern states cannot get access to all these without getting adequate purchasing power (funds) from VAT revenue, and VAT revenue is now a function of consumption, which depend on purchasing power (funds); and at the moment, the Northern states seem to have insignificant command over the nation’s purchasing power! Consequently, they cannot escape from the socio-economic logjam they are entrapped with!”\\n', '\\n', 'Consumption is a function of finance (money), which the North doesn’t have at present. More disturbing is the fact that the North’s finance (consumption level) is predetermined and limited to a level below its need by the financial system; and no matter how hard it strives to go beyond that it cannot exceed the level set for it by the system. “He who pays the piper calls the tune”. Southern Nigeria owns these banks and therefore, it decides who get what from the financial system. These restrictions were explained in detail in my book: “POVERTY TRAP IN NORTHERN NIGERIA: ITS NATURE, CAUSES AND REMEDIES”.\\n', '\\n', 'For the sake of brevity, these restrictions could be seen from the following statistics:\\n', '\\n', '✓ Nigerian Broad money (M3) is the proxy of what we call money today. However, approximately 74.18% of it is the creation of the banking system via a process called: money creation (fractional reserve banking system). Invariably, the banking system has ownership of the created money (significantly owned by the south).\\n', \"✓ Based on the only available public statistics related to credit and deposit (Nigerian Bank's credit/deposit on State Basis from 2010 –2015), Nigerian banks gave approximately 91.01% of their loanable funds (money) in southern part of this country. Within the same period, the 19 states of the North only received 5.20% of the total loanable funds. Thus, the south got 17.5 times of what the North got from the banks as credit for the period 2010-2015.\\n\", 'An in-depth analysis of the above statistics will reveal the gloomy picture of Northern Nigeria in relation to access to purchasing power (money) for consumption.\\n', '\\n', 'I enjoin the Northern leaders to employ experts for thorough research on the above statistics for more insight. The era of naivety in relation to comparative indicators (between the North and the South) should be over, because the spirit of “even development” has long been replaced by the spirit of “zero-sum game”. Hence, Northerners must start to take full control of their finances by establishing their own financial edifices (banks and other financial institutions)! Our leaders should also know, for now, triggering agricultural or industrial revolution in the region will hardly pull the North out of its quagmires provided it has no control over its finance; because, the north will toil hard to produce while the south will simply click to create the money for purchasing the produced commodities. This covert exploitation must stop! I doubt if there is any exploitative means that proved more fatal to the Northern economy than the existing financial ecosystem. Put simply, the North needs a financial ecosystem that is significantly own by it, which will simultaneously regress the economic exploitation and progress its regions forward economically.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. President should know, when the southern states and their pressure groups kicked against the proposed “Ruga” Settlement policy by the then administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, despite all the goodness in it, the former president and the north decided to let go of the project to let peace and spirit of togetherness prevail. Why can’t the present administration reciprocate the same gesture?\\n', '\\n', 'It will be a service for the poor Northerners if you share this information to others, especially to the Northern leaders (governors inclusive) and pressure groups.

The media has effectively turned the discourse into a North vs. South debate, using regional and tribal sentiments as tools to sway public opinion. However, the reality, as I see it, is that this bill will impact all Nigerians equally, irrespective of region or tribe. Once passed, we will all face the consequences.\\n', '\\n', 'Having gone through the CEDDERT Occasional Publication 2024 on the Economic and Political Implications of the Nigerian Tax Reform Bill, 2024, I find the situation deeply disturbing and a matter of great concern. It highlights how our collective focus on regional, religious, and tribal divisions often blinds us to policies that affect us all, regardless of identity.\\n', '\\n', 'Take, for instance, the Nigeria Tax Administration Bill, 2024, which includes provisions for the use of technology in tax compliance. Some key points from the bill include:\\n', '\\n', 'Mandatory Tax Identification Number (TIN):\\n', 'Part II, Section 4 mandates all taxable persons to register for a TIN.\\n', 'Section 8 (1) a-c and (2) make having a TIN a pre-condition for accessing government contracts and opening or operating bank accounts.\\n', 'Automated Tax Compliance:\\n', 'Section 69 empowers tax authorities to use any technology, including third-party platforms and software, to automate tax assessment, collection, and compliance.\\n', 'Quarterly Reporting by Financial Institutions:\\n', 'Section 28 (1) mandates banks, insurance companies, stock-broking firms, and other financial institutions to report quarterly the names of customers with cumulative transactions of ₦25 million (individuals) or ₦100 million (corporate bodies), with or without a specific request from the tax authorities.\\n', 'Implications:\\n', 'These provisions, while appearing progressive on the surface, raise several red flags:\\n', '\\n', 'Violation of Personal Liberties:\\n', 'The automation and reporting requirements have the potential to infringe on individual privacy and could be exploited for political witch-hunting. In a country with weak institutions and a largely informal economy, this poses significant risks.\\n', 'Misclassification of Income:\\n', 'Many transactions in Nigeria’s informal economy are not necessarily income. The lack of nuance in the bill could lead to wrongful assessments and taxation.\\n', 'Privatization of Tax Collection:\\n', 'The bill’s emphasis on technology and the engagement of consultants (Part III, S.11(3) and S.19(4)) paves the way for private companies to dominate tax collection. This is reminiscent of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) initiative, which led to the controversial engagement of Remita as the collection agent.\\n', 'The rush to pass this bill without ensuring that the proposed unified tax authority possesses the requisite capacity and technology could open the door to outsourcing tax collection for enormous fees. Such companies may have vested interests tied to political or private stakeholders.\\n', 'A Call for Caution:\\n', 'The bill’s provisions could exacerbate inequality, deepen mistrust in government institutions, and further marginalize informal sector workers. While modernizing tax administration is important, the focus should be on strengthening the capacity of the unified tax authority before implementing these sweeping changes.\\n', '\\n', 'Instead of succumbing to divisive narratives, Nigerians must look beyond regional, tribal, or religious biases and critically evaluate the long-term implications of this bill. The stakes are high, and it’s time to prioritize national interest over personal or sectional agendas.\\n', '[23/12/2024, 12:29:13] ~\\u202fM I M: DM me.\\n', '\\u200e[23/12/2024, 14:24:21] Aliyu Lumumba Jr Suleiman: \\u200eimage omitted\\n', '[23/12/2024, 14:34:04] ~\\u202fMai-sauki: Distress sales ⚠️ 📢 🚨 \\n', '\\n', ' *ONLY 350 bags remaining* \\n', '\\n', ' NPK 20:10:10 fertilizers available for immediate sales\\n', '\\n', '08030744985\\n', '09070700172\\n', '\\u200e[23/12/2024, 19:22:11] Dr. Ahmed Adamu: INVITATION.mp4 \\u200edocument omitted\\n', '[23/12/2024, 19:22:29] Dr. Ahmed Adamu: *4th Annual Personal Development Workshop*\\n', '\\n', 'We are thrilled to announce the 4th Annual Personal Development Workshop with Associate Professor Ahmed Adamu.
